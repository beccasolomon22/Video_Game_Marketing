Yoshi's Crafted World - Nintendo Switch,Nintendo,Another Win-tendo Jewel!!,"The quirky style that shined in Yoshi’s Wooly World has gotten a serious upgrade in this new gem from Nintendo.  Like all it’s first-party titles, this game is nearly flawless.
The “crafted world” is exceptionally detailed, with cardboard cutouts, Pinterest worth constructions, and vibrant colors that pop on everything from the tiny Switch screen to a 70” flatscreen TV.
The gameplay is tight, with seamless reaction times and plenty of opportunities to save yourself from mistakes.  Easy enough for kids to pick up, but easily enjoyed by gamers of all ages

Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Great Game!,"Some folks didn't like this game....thought it didn't measure up to the original or Forged Alliance. Boy, are they wrong! I thought this game was great! Maybe the tech tree is a tiny bit smaller, but the game more than makes up for it with new, cool units, great graphics and effects, and awesome explosions. In fairness, I was a little perturbed that that more than one engineer cannot build on the same structure, as in the previous games, but then again, the structures go up pretty quick. Happy hunting!",yes: I recommend this product,,2,0,7 years ago,4.0,3.4091,22

Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Not as good as it looks,"there is no infantry, which annoys me a lot because i like the classic infantry, cavalry(armor), artillary idea. The Steam engine is annoying, its really laggy and slow, there are like 5 real units per race and then everything else is an experimental which i really dont like since they are impossible to kill and one experimental unit can kil 10 regular without even trying. The AI is ok but they are just annoying, the game is really confusing and not very fun. I have to get updates everytime i want to play, even when i dont play it online at all, I hate patches. The upgrade trees are wierd and require research to get, which takes forever. Overall this game isnt good, Starcraft 2 is much better if your looking for an RTS and Shogun Total War is also really good. Just dont get this.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,5,9 years ago,2.0,3.4091,22
Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,I don't see how people can't like it,"This game, in my opinion, is WAAY better than C&C and is very good in gameplay and everything else.

I just play it when I'm bored.",yes: I recommend this product,,5,1,10 years ago,5.0,3.4091,22
Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Great...but...,"The story is extremely slow and confusing until you get later into it. It forces you to play as a certain faction first, then another and end with the Cybrans. You should definitely try out the originals, they are ten times better then this. Overall, the gameplay is about the same as the last game, the graphics are much better and the sound and music is again amazing.

Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Best RTS game made so far,"This game is the absolute best RTS game you can play. And I have played alot of RTS games, so I know what I'm talking about. This game has very good graphics, and they will be even more enjoyable the more you paly the game, considering that you notice things like shadows cast by the terrain, and details such as distortion coming out of a walkers exhaust pipes. This game also has an amazing command system. There are more controls and options you can use to make your army do anything imaginable. This game also includes extra experimental weapons, which they balanced much better than on the first one, and actually have a general purpose rather than to walk into the enemies base and kill. And most people have heard that the nukes on the second ones are pitiful compared to the first. The difference is that on the first one, it was a bright light and smoke covering a large area of the map. On this one, it might be only a little bit smaller, but it is insanely detailed, in the fact that an extremely large portion of the map gets lit up in red, and things are actually moving with the explosion as they would in real life. When it touches water it makes steam and jets it into the air, so nukes on this one are much more enjoyable to watch, regardless of what you've heard. All in all, 10 stars.",yes: I recommend this product,,6,0,11 years ago,5.0,3.4091,22
Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Awesome,"I don't know why people don't like this game, because if you like real-time strategy or RTS, this is the game to get.

Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,"good, but a little disappointed","What Gas Powered Games have done here is amazing, this game is packed with more units, new features, less glitches, and a lot more excitment. what i was really taken with is that there is no +mass or -mass anymore, its all based on real numbers. the tech tree feature is amazing, allowing you to upgrade old units to make them more lethal later in the game. a lot of the good things are still their like the cybran ships being able to crawl onto land. however, the story is disappointing, character extremely lack any sort of personality and emotions. also, for high end computers, this game has surprising lower graphics, units like the UEF titan look a little bit more like legos, even though some units have good deatil, others are flat out bad, although you have to appreciate that they are trying to let computers with lower hardware able to run this game. online play and skirmish mode are fun.",yes: I recommend this product,,2,1,11 years ago,4.0,3.4091,22
Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,SC2? or sometihng completely  different?,"Supreme Commander 2 is different than it's ""predecessors"", i say it should just have a completely different name slapped onto it. Then i would of not had any quarrels with it, because i wouldn't be expecting something so different than what i knew. Now i own both of the ""previous"" games and they are both excellent, and so when i found out about this ""sequel"" i ran out and bought it with out much looking into it, i knew it had a different maker but i figured how bad could they have possibly made it... i mean it's Square Enix! Now don't get me wrong it is a good game, but i was expecting to buy SC2... Not SC2 revamped... i couldn't just jump into it, i had to learn the new feel to the game. In SC2 you now get to your good units by having to research most of them, and experimental units are really not that great, yea they are all based of the old games models but i think that most kinda suck comparatively... like the experimental units, for so called ""game breakers"" as they were know for in the old games, u can make them with very little ease and there not nearly as effective as they use to be.... which i guess is the trade off for it, but even hordes of units can crumble in no time it seems.  Regular units are just knock offs of the original ones and are only really good when you upgrade them via research.  However i do think the research is a cleaver aspect of the game and the brand new units/structures that were added are a nice touch, but it does usually take awhile to get to them in the research tree even with the research facilities which u can build to increase research income.  completely  Also the variety of units is gone there use to be at least 2 sets of everything... a lower cost, lower tech versions, and the higher end units, which i prefer the variety of them because they all had there uses, lower tech units could be used as cannon fodder, as your high end tech marches on, or even if you had to come up with an army quickly.  All that said i do still play it as i've gotten use to it, but i am still disappointed, if you are looking for something different to play with a somwhat familiar story, then you would like the game play; especially online to which it seems that it was made for, but if your expecting the feel of the original game then i would say go play one of the old ones...",No: I don’t recommend this product,,2,1,11 years ago,3.0,3.4091,22

When i head there was a Supreme Commander 2 coming out of course I ran right out and got it. I can honestly say this is one of the worst war games period. My reasons include the fact you must unlock a LOT of stuff to even consider playing the quick battles. There's only 6 maps, yes i said 6. The fact you cant even choose what side you want to be on until you unlock the ability, and the WORST part is you cant even see a simple overview of the maps when you are selecting them your basically better off throwing darts at your comp screen to decide what your gonna do rather than actually getting to decide anything at all about the battle ahead.

AWESOME game. right now, im a little concerned with the new unit the cybranasourus rex (yeh, i probably spelled that wrong) it seemed a little like an out of place character to be put in the game. its still a pretty cool unit and theres so much more upgrade. the most important is the eco that they had. the last one sucked and was full of glitches. this one is MUCH more stable, its brings the good parts of halo wars and not the sucky parts (because seriously, halo wars sucked) buy NOW",yes: I recommend this product,,5,0,11 years ago,4.0,3.4091,22

Supreme Commander 2 is missing the best elements and nuances of it's two predecessors. I actually think that TA was the best of them all. Sad that games just get worse and worse as they come out with new titles. What happened to the unit types??!! There is not nearly as many unit types as SC or TA. Plus, what happened to the recycling of plants and rocks... the environmental resources you could live off until you got your resource production up and running? And why are there so few multiplayer maps?  I have an idea. Take the Total Annihilation engine, give it some new graphics,new sound, a new story line and new unit types... and don't change anything else...",No: I don’t recommend this product,,2,3,11 years ago,2.0,3.4091,22
Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Sorry I'm having a hard time speaking its so Awesome!!,"Don't know what the other guys here are talking about, the game is great, ya sure they took out some of the things the sup com pros loved, but the thing is, more people want to play RTS so you can't expect a newbie to grasp every concept of the game, unlike the pros. If they left some of the things from the old sup com in, it would be so unbalanced it wouldn't been as fun to play for the newbies.  Alright so lets get down to buisness, the storyline is great and the graphics blow sup com 1's out of the water, while supporting older computers that don't have as good of processors or graphics card. Win, Win situation. At least thats what I think, and that is why you're here isn't it ??   They added a new research screen to simplify it and added a whole bunch of new features like building add ons and new experimentals. FYI to all aion illuminate fans, they don't have naval anymore. I know, ouch right? Well I think we'll live.  On to sound. They did a really good job with the music this time, its about 10 times better than sup com 1 and the sound effects really match up and exceed what you think they will sound like, when lets say someone gets blown up by a nuke or someones commander goes into meltdown.  For all those hard core gamers out there, the 10 hour battles have gone away, I know, sad right? Well they replaced with a shorter even fiercer model of online game play, that really seems to fit, and when I mean shorter, I mean average of two hours. You can still build those big armies just faster. One thing I wanna finish up with is the Interface. They kept a lot of the interface from sup com 1 and FA, but also added the research screen which I talked about earlier. It works like this: You need research points to buy any sort of research upgrades and those research points automatically come along, but you can build research facilities that increase the speed at which you get them. You can spend research points on things like, personal shields for your units, or new buildings, sight upgrades, radar upgrades, and new schematics for buildings and units. Big FYI for all those 360 gamers lookin at this. The 360 version of this game is just as good if not better than the PC version.",yes: I recommend this product,,3,1,11 years ago,5.0,3.4091,22
Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Do not touch this game with a 10-foot pole,"Make no mistake - this IS Supreme Commander Lite. It almost feels like a very weak demo of SupCom 1, but worse. Even with the new research trees, you'll still end up with no where near the amount of units to choose from that you had with SupCom 1 and its tiers. Yeah, sometimes the tiers were annoying to work through and it took far too long in most instances to get anywhere close to maximizing your faction's potential in a single match in the first one - but this ""sequel"" has completely gutted it altogether. You'll likely end up mashing your mouse button or hotkey to churn out more of the exact same units.. over... and over... and over again because there's barely anything to choose from for unit diversity. The game requires the Steam client and an internet connection just to play. While it's true that most people these days have an internet connection, it's a rather unfortunate decision not only because you're excluding gamers but also because of potential happenstance scenarios. Steam goes down? Sorry, you're out of luck. A few years down the road and something else happens(such as one of the companies going out of the business or whatnot) and you can't go back to play it for old times sake? Again, out of luck. Move to an area with limited connectivity? Same thing. I wish developers would stop going with this route, as it's very short-sighted. The graphics are significantly worse than the first one, even on the highest settings. There are ONLY small maps, and no larger maps to choose from. In the first version you had a large selection of maps, in SupCom2 there are around 10-15, and all of them are the same size pretty much. I want to be clear one more time about the gameplay here: This is not a merely ""different"" approach. I'm pretty open-minded and I'll try just about anything. This is a GUTTED approach to the first version's gameplay. It takes many of the great features out, and doesn't replace them - it does away with them altogether. Fewer units with no tiers or variety. Smaller selection of maps with almost no size difference in any. Worse graphics. Weak experimental units. Gameplay consists primarily of unit churning and zerg tactics. I gave this game the benefit of the doubt because the first one was so great. Please, don't make the same mistake I did. Do not buy this game.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,5,4,11 years ago,1.0,3.4091,22

Single player story is good and easy to get into because you dont need to have played the originals to understand whats going on or anything.

Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,SC 2 - mediocre game.,"There were so high hopes for this game, as SC 1 and FA had left me hungry for more games like TA, yet unfortunately the wait would lead to disappointment. For those who enjoyed the similarities between TA and SC1 will be the biggest disappointment here. The economy of the previously mention games is utterly gone. No worrying about balancing energy usage and mass income with building and firing weapons, its all been removed. Its now a simple straight up, build up army, build base defenses, go conqueror enemy. Also gone are the tech levels, and weaker starting units, and teching up. Instead its replaced by research points that gradually come in much like all the other resources.  Without that element nothing really stood out in the game. Without the challenging economy, the campaign portion of the game becomes simple, build defenses, build army, repair defenses occasionally, attack enemy. Musically nothing really stood out, there may of been a couple times when I stopped to notice it, but again nothing inspiring. Storyline it also seems kinda lacking, it comes off like a Final Fantasy storyline mashed into brief conversations between 18 missions. There just simply is not enough there to make a great story, which once again left me greatly disappointed. Graphically the game was nice, and the small scale compared to SC1, meant I could actually stay somewhat zoomed in, to actually see the units, and not just commanding by click on the small icons. The movies were decent, just way to few of em to tell a good story. The game controls fairly well, being rather simple game now, its easy to pick up and get right into. Those with SC1 knowledge will have no trouble picking it up, as the mechanics are still basically identical to the first. Those used to Starcraft or C&C type games might take a bit longer but overall its not a hard game to get into or to start playing. The game probably has some strengths in multiplayer, as the unit balance does seem good, but I have not done any of that yet. Overall SC2 is not a bad game, everything seems to work, the game loaded smoothly, the game had no noticle lag, or slowdowns, but there is just nothing in it that simply makes it stand out. The game itself was fun to play through, and I did enjoy the limited story, and I may still by the sequel when it comes out (of course the ending had a cliff hanger for a sequel... what game doesn't do that no a days) yet this probably won't be a game I will touch all to often again now that I have beaten it. My suggestion is wait for the price to drop on this one if you simply want to see the continued storyline from the first, as the game offers very little of anything else to draw players away from other games.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,1,1,11 years ago,3.0,3.4091,22
Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Way to destroy the best RTS series ever made!,"First there was Total Annihilation; superb, deep, endless strategy, constantly evolving, hundreds of different units, quick to learn hard to master. Then Supreme Commander and Forged alliance; made Total Annihilation (TA) larger with a better AI, beautiful graphics and much of the same elements that made TA great.  Then Supreme Commander 2; What the hell happened here? You took almost everything that made the first two stand alone and dominate and tossed it out the window. My only guess is you tried to dumb this game down to the likes of a C&C or a Craft game so it could appeal to the zerg boys.... probably thanks to Square's involvement. Really Chris Taylor how much did it cost to convince you to kill your baby?! Graphics went from sci-fi futuristic to cartoonish. Threw out the unique resource allocation and made it a click and buy system with a ""Research"" resource which is another Craft game move that sucks. Took out almost 60% of the different units in the game an dumbed base creation and defense down to arrow towers CRAFT again!. All the maps appear to be zerg/rush maps. Threw out the tier system... Sheesh I can go on and on but I won't. Bottom line: If you loved what made Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander unique and fun, you will hate and loath this game as I did. However if you owned any Craft game or C&C and thought the above mention games were too complex, strategic, and epic for you, then give Supreme Commander 2 a try!  You should feel right at home in this slop show.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,11 years ago,1.0,3.4091,22
Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Nothing like the first two!,"Okay, so yeah, it's pretty much like the first two in the basics: the three factions, the basic units (Some of the basic units are straight out of SupCom 1 and Forged Alliance), and one big war. On almost everything else it's completely revamped. Upgrading has been replaced with ""Researching"", which really adds more hassle to the game, but also adds a new era of customization because instead of just going up levels 1, 2, 3, and Experimental, you can have multiple branches of different customizations, depending on your favored style of play. You can even simply upgrade what units you have instead of the old ""send oldies to suicide to make room for the new guys"" strategy. Actually, it is BETTER to keep the oldies instead of suiciding them, because the longer they stay on the battlefield, the deadlier they become thanks to experience now. The much-famed and even moreso whined-about economy that made SupCom 1 and Forged Alliance so famous (or infamous, lol) has been DRASTICALLY simplified, which on one side makes the game easier to play and a lot less worrisome, but on the other side it makes the game harder because now you can no longer make/build units/structures without first having the resources available, instead of just having that drastic omni-slowdown from the first two. The epic battlefields of the first two games are... well.. gone... No more will you have the massive wave upon wave of units swarming towards your opponent across miles of territory, because they'll now practically be right at your back door. Or front door, side door, or wherever they are positioned on the map. That's one drawback, but makes for much more interesting, heated, and faster-paced battles. The graphics are OUTSTANDING. So detailed you can almost see the individual bolts and weld lines on your ACU in close-up mode. And no more resource-clogging like FA was notorious for, the game runs smooth as silk if you have good enough graphics cards. (My dual ATI ASUS EAH4860s can barely run FA smoothly on even low graphics, but they effortlessly controlled SC2 on the highest graphics settings) I haven't gotten too far into the storyline yet, but it seems to be good so far. You actually play named characters in this game, instead of the generic ""Commander"" of the other two. It looks like an interesting storyline, and the voice acting is decent. The voices fit the characters. All-in-all, this game is not it's brothers, it doesn't have that epic scale quality to it, nor the complexity of the resource system (that complexity is now embedded in the Research system). It's beautifully redone and expertly made, I just wish they could have increased the epic scales to keep with SupCom tradition.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,11 years ago,5.0,3.4091,22

Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,A fun RTS,"So far I've enjoyed playing SC2. there are a handful of differences between it and its predecessors both good and bad, The battles aren't as big as the ones from Supreme commander, but they are still brilliant, the new research is fun, as well as expanding buildings with tactical add on pieces even if they are minor one's, and the fact you can replace your ACU without permanently losing it now, and the new upgrades for the ACU, and units. Most of the cons I've found so far are, requiring steam, the smaller battlefields, and other minor problems which may be fixed eventually in updates. It lacks the feeling of the original game but its still fun to play I'd recommend to everyone that they try the demo on steam first before deciding.

Supreme Commander 2,Square Enix,Sooooo disapointing,"First off, you need to have Steam installed on your computer. Thanks for the heads-up on this Square. You buy a hard copy of the game but then have to log in to Steam to download it from their servers.....really? Some people are showing a 9 hour wait time to be able to play. Again, really? Second, they destroyed the economy and the basic gameplay of the original game and its expansion. None of it even matters any more. Its just a zerg fest. Most people think its due to the console being added to this title and thereby attempting to expand their market. They broke what made the first game such a huge hit. Gone are the days of epic battles for my 3rd point. Maps are now 5kmx5km. WAY too small. Fourth, you can't save/load in skirmish play. Soooo, if you have to leave in the middle of a longer lasting game (not real sure how this will happen being that everything is so small-but want to give them the benefit of the doubt for future content added updates), too bad. Can't save. Fifth, the voice acting and story line for the campaign is just plain stupid. I guess I could go on but I'm sure I've expressed my opinion enough for folks to understand where I'm coming from. This is just insulting to people who have been really looking forward to this title.

Yoshi's Crafted World - Nintendo Switch,Nintendo,Weaponized Cuteness at it's Finest,"Not a heck of a lot wrong with this game. I like to say this is the epitome of Weaponized Cuteness. The designers did a fantastic job with level design. It feels like they actually built every level in the game with cardboard and construction paper in reality and then put it into the game, and they stick with that through the entire game. The controls are tight and the yoshis are as adorable as ever.

The addition of being allowed to manually aim your eggs removes some of the frustration that earlier titles had and there are collectible items in abundance for completionists. That all said, the game is not meant for those looking for a challenge. I don't need dark souls levels of difficulty, but at least some sort of resistance would have been nice. Levels can basically be run through rather blind if you're not hunting for every red coin or flower. Even the challenge levels at the end of the game don't really have much bite to them.

The biggest hiccup in the game I think is the mini quests you get. Each level has multiple different set pieces that a robot will want you to collect. The issue is you can only do one at a time so the game asks you to play through one level at least 6 or 7 times and it can get rather tedious at times. My suggestion is that if you are collecting everything, don't try to get it all at once because I assure you you will be back through that level multiple times.

In the end the game is a relaxing adventure through a handcrafted (Almost literally) world that never fails to charm. Perfect for players of all ages, but if you're looking for a challenge I would look elsewhere.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,1,0,2 years ago,4.0,4.6556,2390

Yoshi's Crafted World - Nintendo Switch,Nintendo,Yoshi's Basic Mind in a Challenging World,"So far this game is VERY challenging but it's mostly getting used to the unique environment. The story line is as childish as the other Yoshi games prior. However, when you consider that the whole premise is set from the perspective of a Yoshi who is still technically a baby/child at this time it becomes easy to understand how primitive their mind works and forgive the innocence of a basic story line. The game is very easy to play but the environment makes for a challenge. If you have played Yoshi's Story for N64 or Yoshi's Wooly World it is very similar to the side scroller you know and love but the difference is being able to reverse the levels and access items from afar by shooting eggs. Still a long way to go in this game myself, personally so I cannot give it the ending a review but it is worth a play through in my opinion from what I have seen so far.

Yoshi's Crafted World - Nintendo Switch,Nintendo,Carefully Crafted Joy,"Yoshi's Crafted World is everything I had hoped for -- a solid Yoshi title that I can choose to play casually when I want some mellow fun, or play obsessively to go for 100%.

The gameplay is not revolutionary, but I don't think it needs to be. It is clear that the developers crafted (pun unintended) each level with care; the rewards are in the details of the levels as opposed to the sprawling layouts of the original SNES game.

Sometimes it can feel tedious to play the same levels over and over again to complete every quest, so I remind myself to move on.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,0,0,2 years ago,5.0,4.6556,2390

A true masterpiece of Nintendo's ""labor of love"" towards the games they create. Honestly, I thought the demo of this game was a bit of a letdown. The demo was a sluggishly paced level of pure thoughtless ease regardless of the fact that it looked and was mechanically sound. Being the Nintendo fan that I am I picked it up regardless to try it for myself and I can easily say to date on the Switch it is in my top 3 favorite 1st party Nintendo games on Switch.

STORY OF SEASONS: Friends of Mineral Town  - PlayStation 4,XSEED Games,Addicting Little Game But Pretty Bare Bones,"Take this with a grain of salt as I've never played the original version. But it's a perfectly serviceable SOS game; pretty fun, addicting even, but doesn't go out of it's way to be anything spectacular. The character portraits are great, but the 3D models are sub par. The gameplay is fun and gives you plenty to do and unlock, but the Fatigue animations have no right being that long and often, and seems it was only put in there to pad out the game and/or annoy you. There are also issues of you getting stuck in your horse after you dismount, and getting blocked by villagers (you have to wiggle to get unstuck) which could've been avoided if they made the hitboxes a little smaller. As much as I criticize; I still get a lot of enjoyment out of it. I love taking care of my animals and wooing the bachelors/bachelorettes (the dialogue is cute and funny too). If you like the SOS or the HM series I believe you will enjoy it; it's just a shame that it's pretty bare bones.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,0,0,2 months ago,3.0,4.6667,6

I for one who enjoys stealth type games/characters and I loved playing this.

Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,Thief,"I didn't have extremely high hopes for this game, but it still disappointed me in some ways. I thought this game was going to be more of an open world in which I could steal almost anything, but this was not the case. A lot of the items that you are able to steal are similar, so it gets repetitive and I lost interest in it over time. The storyline is forgettable as well as the side characters. It all feels pretty generic. The control scheme is a bit tricky, too, and it took a little while to get used to it. The game includes things like lock picking, wirecutting, and things of that nature, but it just doesn't have the lasting appeal. After having finished the game, there were side missions that I could complete for some extra coin (provided by Garrett's friend Basso), but I wasn't interested in doing the tedious jobs.

This however was a flat out disappointment to me. The graphics are last gen and not new gen. The controls were horrible and the game-play was sub par. The world was boring, flat, and hard to navigate. Missions were not special either. I understand it is called Thief and you're suppose to lurk in the shadows, but could it have been any darker? Couldn't see obstacles, doorways, pathways, or pretty much anything. The combat was clunky and lack luster as well. I played through the first few levels and then shut it off and traded it out for Watch Dogs. At least I got my moneys worth from that game!

So games have been part of my entire life. I don't want people to think I am just bashing a game as a first time game-player. The previews of this game looked amazing but once you play it all you do is sneak in shadows and loot cabinets. Literally thats all you do. You will also get an uncontrolable avatar that jumps from sneak point to sneak point. It is very annoying especially when you are trying to go undetected. It is also not a free roaming game as most of us define free roaming. I could deal with the no free roaming, bad sound track, and poor story if you did a bit more than just loot people houses.

I didn't like how short the focus feature lasted which left me spending hours looking for secret buttons and things to interact with so I could either find my way out of a place or continue the game. It would probably be good for kids that have a lot of time to spend on mundane things. I realize the game is about stealth but my character ""Edward"" can't defend himself or punch his way out of a paper bag- it's pathetic. It would also be nice if the field of vision was better especially when on ledges or close quarters but he usually can't look all the way up or down which is silly.

Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,Rather disappointing.,"As a fan of the earlier Thief games I was very happy that someone has decided to continue on with the IP, but all in all I was less than impressed. It's like they took the antiquated gameplay from over a decade ago, and just updated the graphics. The mechanics and overall feel of the game are as if the developers had never even heard of games like Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, Hitman, or Dishonored. The world isn't very open, paths to take are quite linear, and loading screens before each new area completely destroy any effort they made to be immersive. I found the audio to be frequently quite aggravating, as guards tend to mindlessly repeat the same handful of phrases, and the volume doesn't seem to vary well with distance - so even if a guard is on the other side of the room, he's just as loud as if he were standing right next to you. Shadows are not always well defined, and object interaction is limited and repetitive. So you get no real sense of depth. I really think they could have done so much better with this game, but it's still worth a play through, if only for nostalgia's sake.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,7 years ago,2.0,3.52,125

The game has really nice graphics, but the game play mechanics are very poor. Anytime you actually get into to combat it is horrible because you can barely control how your person fights.

The controls I didn't like at first but got used to it, the controls feel like a FP version of Assassins Creed, (only the controls). This game is built around sneaking not combat so it's not a game where you can take all enemies head on, it takes skill and thinking to play it and is one of my favorite titles. Pros: Side Missions, Sneak and Steal element, Easy to learn controls.

Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,Not great... but good,I played this game for about an hour or so. their are some ups and downs. The Things that i really enjoyed was how they incorporated the use of shadows. So I thought that was very cool. The game play can be a bit stiff but it can get very intense at times as well. It feels the creators of this game did not put much effort into this game. The sounds are ok. And I'm not really feeling any emotion of the characters. And the running and the jumping is only one button... i like to control everything on a character especially a first person game. the guards all look the same. the fighting is quite lame. it literally makes you to just use your bow. and the knock out is simply a hit to the head... every single time. IT gets very boring and repetitive. But it makes you want to keep playing because the story is actually quite interesting.,No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,7 years ago,3.0,3.52,125

Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,I Have Waited for a Game Like This for a Long Time,"I honestly fell in love with this game as soon as I started playing it. Thief is one of the best games I have ever played because I have also loved stealthy parts in video games and when I play online against other people in first person shooters, I was always the stealthy/tactical player. The story-line and gameplay for this game is just superb. Graphics are amazing and so it the sound quality. Just love the stealthy aspect about the game going around, hiding in the shadows, using my blackjack, shooting my bow, and most importantly... stealing haha. A game like Thief is so rare now these days. A game that requires strategy, patience, maturity, intelligence, and most importantly..... stealth skills. People need to stop hating on this game just because it's not your typical Call of Duty or Battlefield. This game is so underrated and deserves a lot more positive attention.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,7 years ago,5.0,3.52,125
Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,Not as good as I had hoped.,I was really excited for this game before it came out. But quickly realized it wasn't what I expected and I got bored fast. All the game is about is being sneaky and trying to avoid combat. Let me tell you this gets old quick. I'm on chapter 5 and I can't sit down and play this game for hours on in because it's the same thing almost always. Sneak and steal sneak and knock a guy out rinse and repeat. The dialogue isn't that great either. One good thing I can say about this game is the environment looks pretty cool and some of the music during some scenarios are fitting. The game isn't terrible but it's far from great. It's good for 1 play through but nothing more. I give it a 7/10.,No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,7 years ago,4.0,3.52,125
Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,Done right.,"Thief by Square Enix/Edios Montreal is once again doing it right. This game has a lasting appeal. I knew I would want to try Thief since I played Tomb Raider by the same people. I love the graphics, sound of the city and the massive map. You can go anywhere on the map and play the objectives as you see best. You have three options on every objective to either be a ghost, opportunist, or a predator. With completing the objective you are rewarded if you meet the assignments according to what option you have choose. The game tracks your actions to how you react with the surrounding environment thus it determines which option (ghost, opportunist, or predator) you have chosen to become. The sounds of the city are as real as you could imagine. There are so many ways to play this game and so many decisions to make as you make your way through the city trying to steal everything you can. It is in first person, I normally do not like that, but I do enjoy it with this game. Thief is absolutely a game to add to the Xbox One vault in your home.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,7 years ago,4.0,3.52,125
Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,Destroying a series,"I had high hopes when Eidos Montreal said they were making this game I had high hopes this is the company that did Deus Ex: Human Evolution which was a beautiful game. There are some minor problems with this which I can deal with but when you add them up it starts to feel like they just didn't care about the franchise that they were making. (1) The voice acting in the cutscenes was average but when half of the times the lips and the voice move off key and it looks like a English dubbed Chinese movie. (2) The characters in the story are so boring they have no appeal to the story and they are very forgetful. (3) the load point between parts of the city were stupid crawling in between boxes and lifting a log at the end was to generic they could of changed up the animation to different parts. P.s also I've only ever had motion sickness once in gears of war franchise when you run, and this game was making me sick I had to play in 1 hour runs. did this happen to anyone else?

Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,Best Game In A While,"The storyline in this game is really intriguing. The gameplay and combat is incredibly fluid. The only problem I've had is that some of the cutscenes have been kind of skippy, and the graphics are acceptable but not fantastic. Unlike some other stealth games (ahem, assassin's creed) it is not impossible to use stealth successfully not necessarily all the time but as a useful strategy in certain spots.

Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,U Serious>?,"Okay! I had to write a review. I do not do this often. From the first time I had watched the preview for this game I was enthralled. I just had to have it. I went out and reserved it. I thought about Garrett constantly. Ryse and Tomb Raider kept me satisfied. Thief was gonna be better Right>? I mean it was gonna be Epic>...........Wrong.....Controlling Garrett is like controlling a dog on a leash who doesn't want to go in the same direction. The combat is awkward. Garrett is very limited in space. There is a white flash that crosses your vision repeatedly (I do not know why). I was bored within the first mission. The controls are sloppy and NOT user friendly. This game has been the biggest epic fail in my gaming career. I am 34 years old and have been playing for a long time. I now have a game and guide that are useless. I could go on and on in a more inappropiate manner but, I will not. Also you continue to steal the same items over and over, Candle holders, Knifes, rings, mask, gears, magnifying glass.......There is no free roaming. I felt like I was in a box.

Thief - Xbox One,Square Enix,Falling Short,"I wanted this to be a great game and it simply fell short of all expectations. The stealth mechanics are excellent, some of the best I have experienced. The graphics and overall game play, however, are not very good at all. This feels like a PC game, not an XBox One (console) game. Climbing and jumping down are horrible. You can never really tell when you are able to jump down off of a ledge and often you simply can't. Stealing things is often an exercise in patience, as you (slowly) open a cabinet, (slowly) pick up a goblet, and (slowly) close the door again. Try doing that before the guard returns and more often than not, you don't. Voices are often disembodied, or worse, come from the wrong direction. I finished the first two chapters without even discovering where to purchase (or craft) arrows that I need to stealth properly. This is the kind of game that you either like or don't. If you do, then more power to you. If you don't, then faults abound. Looks like I will add this to the shelf of ""rainy day"" games when I am bored out of my skull.

Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet - PlayStation 4,Bandai,Where choices don't matter!,"(minor spoilers) 
I have completed the game and I have many issues about it. One is that the game boasts about choice but 99% of it doesn't differ from pressing X to continue. The choices you have have the same outcome or response but the description makes a big boast about how your decisions matter. The illusion of choice but extremely obvious it doesn't matter. 

For example, you get something like ""What should we do boss? ""

> let's save her mom
> we came here to meet her mom. 

PLOT HOLES EVERYWHERE! This game should be avoided at all cost if you believe common sense should exist. The game forgets its own mechanics when major events occur. Why would one try to attempt sacrifice so save someone at low hp when the skills: extreme healing shots, self healing, invulnerable block, and free dodging skill exists. Brilliant. 

Some fights or adventures are cut short even if you're doing extremely well, also you'll be shown with a single pistol and weak so you'll fit their plot line. 

You become a leader, but have zero leader choices. Makes absolutely no impact to the game even though they make a big commotion about it. 

The conversations and emotions are comparable to Jr high level. Everyone must be hormonal in order to think and act like they do here. All of which your single dialog choice (appears as two) has no impact and is barely better than one what you hear from the main cast. 

AI is horrific and can throw sticky grenades, knives, ect through walls with perfect accuracy. Be ready for an extremely unfair fights. So I hope you're ready to cheese some conflicts. 

Dodging mechanic can make dark souls experts cry. When you crouch your movement is either extremely slow or a forced stop of the trigger is pulled. You cannot move while firing crouched. Well, when you roll you are forced into a crouch at the end. You can try to roll again with the same result or jump out of it. This dodge doesn't work well on many attacks. 

Dialog and development choices are very poor. 
-8-10 cut scenes when they try to redo a boss fight? 
-confusing weapon modification and dungeon warp system. 
- have a single discussion between party members on quests that repeats every 5 minutes
-""enemy players"" have rediculous accuracy and damage. 
- unable to change weapons, skills, level up, or purchase bullets on quests. You must return to do any of this. Due to this, of you equip a new type weapon and go on a mission, you will likely have to restart when you find you have zero ammo and no notification of this. 
-players jumping and grappling are extremely clunky. 
-if you wish to do any meaningful side content you must restart the game to get to it. 
-story is more about your partner, kirito & friends, and your partner. I recognize I said that twice but that's how much it focuses on. You have a throw away character with essentially no meaningful impact on the game. 
-all throwable tools are hard to aim with! Fixed distance and can't aim up or down. 

Pros:
I loved the character creator. 

Game is more forgiving with deaths compared to previous Sao games. You keep all you've collected including exp and credits. 

Subquest and bounties speed up process as they can be redone and are flexible. 

Falling off a cliff removes very little hp and teleports you back. However this would happen less if the grabble and jump wernt horrible.

Original voices and subtitles! However there's no English audio. So there's no choice.

Customizable controls. 

Loot system is nice. 

Customizable partner is amazing.

Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet - PlayStation 4,Bandai,Overall a very fun experience,"It's hard to sum up my feelings about this game since I have so much to say but overall I highly recommend this game. If you like anime/jrpgs anything like that you will have a great time as long as your stick through the intro. The intro is very spoon fed which was off putting for me since I usually play jrpgs and the like so it felt very basic and the tutorial/explanations were somewhat slow to me since I already felt like I understood about the game already. Overall the game play is fluid (I play on a ps4 pro) I haven't experienced any glitching, lag or otherwise poor performance. The game is fun, there's a lot of content and a lot of innerworkings that keep it challenging as well as interesting (character customizations are in depth and fun, as well as how you can play with character builds, skill/gadget sets, and modify and enhance weapons) not to mention there's a ton of dlc that really adds a substantial amount of gametime.

Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet - PlayStation 4,Bandai,Best installment yet,"Bought this game about 2 weeks ago for my kid, he loves SAO. I have played previous installments in the franchise and this one is the best so far. Still needs a bit of improvement but good. A positive thus far is the AI controlled teammates aren't too bad, I have seen much worse. Graphics are good, story line is interesting, character development is pretty straight forward, and there is a decent amount of customization. That said some big negatives is weapon selection can be a little limited, types of enemies is very limited and repetitive, and overall game play could use some improvements to bring in more in line with similar games in the genre.

Right from the begining yiu make your own avatar and can change it anytime! 
Sure Kirito, Asuna, Shinon and the rest of the gang are here too of course, but it's not a shrine built to one character.
The controls are easy enough to get used to and the tutorial is very helpful and flexible. A bit long in the tooth. This is not the game to play on a tight schedule. The cut scenes will take time. I wish it were in English though.

Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet - PlayStation 4,Bandai,"Repetitive ""dungeons"" and middle school drama","After 19 hours I couldn't take any more.  All these kids talking in Japanese while I'm trying to read in English and all they talk about is playing a game within the game you're playing and meeting in real life.  There are some points where the story gets you amped up - a character says ""Hey!  I know where an awesome sniper rifle is!  Let's go get it"" and instead of you venturing forth to get it, it just continues to show you two talking then says something like ""Wow! that was a fun journey getting that sniper rifle!"" and.. that's it.  The ""dungeons"" are big square corridors where you fight 4 different robot-looking enemies.  A robot guy, a robot spider, a flying robot, and sometimes a boss.  In the regular world you fight different colored robot guys, scorpions, and bees.  Sometimes a sandworm and a robotech thing.   The movement is very smooth and the graphics are very nice.  I could have done without the two hours of dialogue in the beginning of the game.  I just wanted to shoot some stuff, but all everyone wanted to do was talk.  If you're a fan of the anime and spamming the shoot & reload buttons then I guess this is for you.  If you're looking for an RPG shooter with a story you can follow, I'd go someplace else.     OH! And for some reason, if you save another player enough times in battle, they fall asleep in your room in the game in their underwear.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Fun gameplay and story sprinkled with nostalgia,"As someone who discovered Zelda later in life, this game has been a treat. I’ve played the regular Nintendo versions and most recently the 3ds re-releases. This felt like the best of both worlds. The better graphics while maintaining the traditional style felt seamless. The great story telling of Ocarina of Time mixed with nostalgic Hyrule of old. I wasn’t a fan of Majoras Mask and so far haven’t found much carry over into this version, which for me is a plus. It’s semi open world as you can roam on your own time completing side quest or tackle the main story utilizing the town and its people to solve riddles, mazes, and boss battles. The graphics still hold up in 2019 for my eyes at least. I’ve seen the new Links Awakening and while stunning, it’s not difficult to immerse myself back into this game. Dated graphics don’t distract from the game play like some 3ds games. The 3D helps with that as this is the only game I’ve been able to play with the 3D on the whole time without getting a headache.

The controls are very responsive and the music is incredible as always. Of course you have the regular guys like Link, Zelda and Ganon, but, this game introduces three new important characters: Hilda, Yuga and Ravio all three play important roles in the epic story. Also, this game is both a sequel and a remake of A Link To The Past. One of the major things that sets this Zelda apart from all the others is that items are not found in dungeons, You rent/ buy items from Ravio.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,In my top five Zelda Games.,"So, I'm a massive Zelda fan. I've played all but three games, The first two (I don't have an NES) and Skyward Sword (I refuse to buy a Wii). A Link Between Worlds is only out ranked by Wind Waker, Ocarina of Time and maybe Minish Cap or Majora's Mask. I absolutely love the game. It is absolutely beautiful to look at, the sound track is amazing, the gameplay feels like the Minish Cap and I believe it will, or at least should, become a classic. However, it's not all good. There are two mechanics that I find interesting. First, is the 'wall merge' this is a cool little mechanic that allows you to merge into a wall for a short time. It's not that I don't like this mechanic, but it's integrated into a ton of puzzles and I have a tendency to forget about the more gimmicky mechanics like this which causes me to get stuck (even on my third play through). Second, is that you 'rent' most of you items. Now, this one really sucks. When you die you lose all of those items. But that is not the reason I hate this mechanic; the reason I hate this mechanic is that you never know just exactly what you're going to need in a dungeon. If it weren't for this mechanic Link Between Worlds would easily be my favorite game of all time; it is awful and should NEVER be put into another Zelda game.",yes: I recommend this product,,5,0,5 years ago,4.0,4.6818,396
The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Fun to the max!,"In my opinion, his is one of the coolest games of the Legend of Zelda series. Considering how many games there are, that's saying something! It's not too easy, but it's not impossible. The effect of being able to merge into walls is incorporated immensely, which I think makes the game all the better. The duration of the game isn't too lengthy, however I can't really give you a good estimate on that since I binge-played for a couple of days... Anyway, I think this game is worth the buy!",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,6 years ago,4.0,4.6818,396
The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,The Legend of Zelda in its purest form.,"The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds embodies everything that the Zelda franchise is, and should be, in its purest form. I would call this THE definitive Zelda game, and the one that any fan of the franchise absolutely MUST play, if they want to maintain any level of credibility.

Zelda, before all else, is a game about exploration, and puzzles. Delving into caves and dungeons is the vision Miyamoto had when creating the first one, and has been the game's signature modus operandi for the last 27 years. ALBW is that, in its purest form. Unlike almost all previous Zelda games, this one offers you almost absolute freedom to you as far as your adventure's direction. Aside for the Sand Rod only being obtainable after you finish a certain dungeon, you are presented with all of Hyrule's dungeons at once, ready for your spirit of adventure to explore at any point in time.

While the story does suffer slightly for this, with no smooth progression throughout, gamers that don't absolutely require a constant narrative won't be put off by this fact. The underlying plot remains, with you rescuing/retrieving several Artifacts of Plot Progression +1, true to Zelda Style, upon whose collection, the story progresses accordingly. There is, unfortunately, very, very little character development of any sort, perhaps the single notable case being Ravio. While I am a sucker for character-driven gameplay, this game doesn't style itself as a character-driven game, and as such, cannot be faulted for this.

The second distinctive feature of Zelda gameplay is puzzles, and this is where ALBW bursts forth, outshining the rising sun and bestowing cinnamon tans upon gamers the world over. The puzzles in this game are easily the best that any Legend of Zelda game has seen. Ever. The game's core mechanic of turning into an image on a wall comes into use in every dungeon, and many places in the overworld. Sometimes it is used in obvious ways, and in others in such brilliant ways that, even though the game clearly requires the player to use them, one just can't help but pat themselves on the back, because it is just that satisfying.

Make no mistake, A Link Between Worlds makes you feel smart. The ultimate puzzle master, the likes of which Professor Layton would bow to! The game's numerous puzzle-solving items come in handy in a wide variety of ways, and are of a rather wide variety themselves. The devs showed some real creativity with some of them, while others are simply iconic to the Legend of Zelda series, such as the Hookshot and Bombs.

But this leads me to one of the game's few shortcomings: The Boomerang. Simply put, the thing is useless. EVERYTHING it can do, the hookshot can do better, and there is a grand total of ONE puzzle in the game (In an option mini-dungeon that leads to a stack of rupees, specifically) in which only the boomerang, and not the hookshot, will work. Truth be told, I think the Boomerang was only put into the game because of how iconic it is, and that irks me.

Other lackluster items would be the Sand Rod and Gust Stick, or whatever it was called. The two are extremely situational, but both have positive traits to outweigh their obsolescence. The Sand Rod, for one, makes for some INCREDIBLE strategies. While utterly useless in combat, and basically anywhere outside of the desert, the Sand Rod's function, and its ability to work in tandem with Link's imaging power made the Desert temple, hands down, the most interesting, fun, and fulfilling dungeon in the game. Sadly, the rod is of no use whatsoever after that, aside for retrieving one Maiamai in the village. After the Boomerang, I say this should be the last item you upgrade.

The Gust Stick, while bordering on useless as a puzzle item, is one of the best items in combat once upgraded. When empowered by the Mother Maiamai, it stuns anything within its (now greater) range, and I was surprised to find it probably the most useful weapon in the gauntlet on top of the Mountain.

Others often cite Ravio's lending and selling items as one of the game's faults, but when you set aside the frustration, you have to admit the system is brilliant. It's a punishment for death so that it's not just a slap on the hand, gives you a reason to save and economize those rupees you save up.

I can't emphasize enough just how fantastic a Zelda game this is. The only person I would not recommend this to would be one who only likes character and narrative-driven games .",yes: I recommend this product,,2,1,6 years ago,5.0,4.6818,396

I was expecting more of a fast-paced action game, not necessarily a puzzle game with a little bit of action. Nonetheless I love it! I understand the hype about the zelda games now.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,An enduring top-down perspective!,"While it saddened me to learn that Zelda Link Between Worlds wouldn't be developed in the 3D perspective like its modern counterparts, I wasn't about to pass up a new Zelda game. This game utilizes the top-down perspective in ways I could've never thought possible, and the 3D is particularly stunning in this form. The mechanics of being able to merge into walls is a blast, and temporarily renders the perspective to something of 3D as I mentioned earlier (not to be confused with the 3D effects of the system itself). I'll admit this game is not as challenging as many past titles, but regardless it is a fun ride with enough references to A Link to the Past to make any Zelda veteran feel right at home. The open world concept gives a broader sense of freedom and exploration, which I love. My only complaint is the inability to connect across wifi for shadow battles. Streetpass is a cool feature, but I'll never understand why it seems to take priority over online features.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Great installment to the Zelda franchise,"Acting as a sequel to The Legend of Zelda A link to the Past, A Link Between Worlds presents itself as a great game for fans of the series. The plot for the game will keep you captivated throughout, with the final scene leading to the battle with the final boss presenting a huge plot twist. The 3D feature adds a lot to the game, as players visit Hyrule and Lorule in 3D and merge in and out of painting form in 3D. While there aren't many items in the game, the ones offered are some of the my personal favorite, like the fire rod and the tornado rod. All in all, this game is one of my favorite Zelda games.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Disappointingly Easy,"What can I say? It isn't what I was expecting. I'm an extreme Legend of Zelda fan, and I'm used to them having puzzles and challenges. I'm used to spending ages in a dungeon, trying to figure it out. I'm used to fighting tricky bosses. So far, this game has none of that. The dungeons are frustratingly easy; I finish them in half an hour. I haven't gotten stumped once, and the bosses have no chance against me. Fairy? Why would I need a fairy? I can kill a boss and barely be damaged. Actually, I beat a boss yesterday WITHOUT losing hearts. I like the new power this game brings, and I like the music, but that's about all I can say about it... I don't like the idea of renting items either because then what satisfaction do you have in solving a dungeon? I'm used to beating a dungeon, and then being excited because now I can go do some side mission with my new item! Not anymore. One more thing, what's this about having unlimited arrows and bombs? All I have a hope of getting from any chest or person is gold or a heart piece. I miss finally beating that mini-game and getting a bigger quiver! How fun it was. ~sighs~ I feel as if this game is geared towards children, and I'm, like I said, disappointed.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,A game worth obtaining!,"The Legend of Zelda series has few games that should not be owned and pretty much none by hardcore LoZ fan, this is no different. This game was truly epic and came with everything I wanted in a LoZ game! The gameplay is fun and very easy to pick up, sound is great with epic music and such, animation is great with a classical feel to it. The storyline at first was kind of throwing me off a bit, but once you get deeper into it; it'll not only hold your attention, but make you want to keep playing. My biggest struggle was to remember I could paste myself to a wall to get around and avoid enemies. This is because I'm used to having to fight/roll away or something.

The gameplay is spectacular, nothing wrong with that! This game took me months to beat, because there are so many different minigames, and dungeons.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Almost perfect,"Though I’ve only thoroughly played and beaten two Zelda games, I am confident A Link Between Worlds will be remembered as a high point in the series. The game’s old-school Zelda style is significantly different from that of more modern titles, and it’s a truly triumphant return. The item collection aspect is surprisingly fun, helping to bolster the game’s somewhat weak post-story (more on that later). Perhaps the quest to obtain every last tool, weapon, and heart piece is so addictive because most, if not all, of the collectibles will contribute to your combat skills, and therefore each directly affects regular gameplay. This improvement of fighting capability is made sweeter by the StreetPass Shadow Link battles, which let the player battle AI representations of other people’s characters, complete with individual items and equipment. This feature, too, helps make the game last longer, though I wish there was a way to directly do battle with others.

The game’s graphics are good, and the use of the 3D effect is exemplary; it legitimately contributes to some parts’ visual quality. The soundtrack and sound effects are both great, also. Of particular quality are the Overworld themes of both Hyrule and Lorule. The story is good, and the characterization of Ravio, Princess Hilda, and Yuga is nicely executed (for a video game). The optional order of dungeon completion (in Lorule) was a nice addition, too. The combat system is simple yet effective, and though some Lorulean enemies are a bit overpowered, this should be mitigated by eventual health and weapon upgrades. And though some specific instances in the game felt a bit obscure as to how to progress, this can probably be attributed to my inaptitude at Zelda games. Rest assured, enough experimentation and exploration can generally solve most puzzles and problems.

The only real place wherein A Link Between Worlds falters is in lasting appeal. Though the aforementioned item collection is fun, the game could have used a better post-story. And by better post-story, I mean *a* post story. There is none. After beating the final boss, you’re reset to right before the showdown. This is very annoying to me, generating a perpetual feeling of incompleteness, even after the player has collected every last item. I understand that the way in which the story ends somewhat prevents a playable post-story, but I’m still disappointed. And though the StreetPass functionality is fun, and the challenge of scoring best times at the Treacherous Tower is an option, it’s hard to dedicate much time to perfecting myself in those mini-games. This is because, at its core, Zelda isn’t really a game that’s meant to be a competitive, “share-with-your-friends”-type experience. And the Second Quest isn’t very enticing either, with too little changed aspects to make it worth it. Still, A Link Between Worlds is an awesome game, and I would definitely recommend it if you’re a fan of the adventure genre.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,7 years ago,4.0,4.6818,396

Between the storyline, gameplay, graphics, music and more the game accomplished everything and more in a Zelda game.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,A Link Between Worlds - Game Review,"A Link Between Worlds is an instant classic and it is going to be a huge influence for future gaming. It had a perfect balance with retro gameplay and modern gameplay as well. I love the creativity with the portrait effect. The orchestrated music is so amazing. I love how in every situation it would switch the soundtrack constantly. There are lots of enjoyable mini games with nice rewards at the end. Of course, you can enjoy the adventure throughout the light/dark world in 3D. I'm glad that they took advantage with the 3D because it's like a cherry on top of a magnificent sundae. Now the only complain I have is that game isn't as challenging, or as difficult as other Zelda games. I didn't feel the urgency or the edge of the seat situation like I had with ""A Link to the Past"" or ""Ocarina of Time."" (especially on dungeons and boss battles.) But yet again that is why they added ""Hero Mode"" just for hardcore gamers like myself. To make a long story short... its a must buy!!

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Best handheld game I ever played!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds is one of my fav games ever made! The graphics are very good with rich lighting and beatiful colors. In the first few seconds of gameplay you will see a bird flying over the large game world form right outside your house in the game. The game might have a top down view but it is still looks great with live time lighting and amazing things to see. Very smooth animation with great uses of motion blur to make it feel so real. The 3D adds a amazing pop between layers and turning in to a painting lts u see the simamatic view of the charecter models in 3D moving about as well as all the other objects around u from a different angle. Zelda is also a beautiful lady in this game.... I wish she was real.... Such a nice lady to.... Any way.... The sound effects are also great u can hear the birds, you can hear your sword cutting throw the air. And you can hear your own foot steps perficly in line as you walk or run throw the game world. The game takes a different apporch no longer are all the key idea's found in the games brilantly designed dungons but they u can now buy them from a friendly if not greedy merchant or rent them. How ever if u rent them and die he will take them back so this adds a punishment for death and makes u more teance. The combat is smooth and almost all your idea's have effect in it. The smooth animation and clashing of meadal sound effects. As well as some well designed bosses and a adivtive streetpass shadow Link duals make the combat surpisily enjoyible if not a bit sempictic and repetive compared to passed resent Zelda games. Each chearacter in the game has a great personilty as a part of the story and the story is full of lour and gives amazing context for futher Zelda games in the timeline like OOT and Major'as Mask. The story is meaningful and emotional at times it is inspirerd by some real world history and thouse who dig hard enogh will fine a amazing meaing in the games design both story and gameplay really make you feel like your own a adventure. How ever the open world is great and broght to life in a all new way its the same basic lay out as A Link to The Pass. This may bring back great memorys of one of 16 bit games finest express and it hold up today very well. But the lake of changes to the hub world did seem a little strange as many of the parts of history they draw from comes from differet arrows of roamen history ect. Yet the over world is not roamen or really changed to fix the story. It does not feel overly nastogic but its open world design is some what limmed my its roots. That said the story blow my mind as did the amazing puzzles in the all new doungons. Some puzzles have different ways to sove them and are all amazingly design to give u the amazing feeling of soving a great Zelda dougon. And if u get stuck you can go see the fortion teller or buy hints with play coins for a ghosts. The story and level design were so emotionaly powerful for me this game gets my full recomenation and 2013 game of the year! Buy it now! And follow me on Miiverse my Nintendo Net Work Id is 3DSFlo.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,This is Great game,OK Legend of Zelda series is a great one. But this one is one of the better ones. It is very difficult to figure out sometimes so I admit I used walkthroughs so one bad thing for the game but it is a long campaign so that is a big plus took me two weeks at 5 hours a day two complete.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"Having played ""A Link to the Past"", ""A Link Between Worlds"" was chock full of nostalgia for me. The over world map, the music, the art style, it all hearkens back to the SNES classic. The gameplay is fun and the ability to start with most of the items sets it apart from previous titles.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,One of the best games ever made.,"It takes a special kind of game to make me like that genre. And I like that genre. I would give it a rating just above Portal, which would be a 9.7/10. The gameplay is fantastic. The graphics are okay, with about the level of a late Gamecube/early Wii game. However graphics never sold me a game. The real thing that sells me any Legend of Zelda title is the exploration and puzzle solving. The amount of exploration and non-linearity that is contained within this game is perfect. I have never played a game that did exploration better. The only possible downside is that there is no challenge in finding rupees. Wherever you go, there shall be rupees.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,A great adventure,"What can I say? I've always loved TLoZ games, and this one is not an exception.
The story is really entertaining and well scripted. The graphics cartoon-type, but who cares about that anyway? The music, right from TLoZ orchestra, beautiful.
This is the type of videogame that gets me right in front of the 3DS screen for hours, not only to figure out what to do in the dungeons, but also to explore the nostalgic Hyrule and its new secrets, and of course the new Lorule with all its crazy inhabitants.
Another thing I also liked from this game is the fact that is not linear at all. I mean, in other Zelda games you have to go from an specific dungeon to another specific dungeon, but in this one you can go in the order you want. Its a small, but very notable change... at least for me.
If I had to take a favorite character from this game (just this game), its would probably be Ravio. Not because is (spoiler) Link's counterpart (/spoiler), but because he's some funny looking and acting guy. And that Ravio's shop was also a new and kinda frustrating thing (fighting enemies all day for some cash, woo!).
Also he talks. 'Nuff said.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,"Oh, the disappointment...","I love Legend of Zelda, to the point where I have associated comic books, tattoos, etc. So I was all excited to play this game. I beat the whole thing in less than a week of mostly casual play; my job had kept me pretty busy that week, so I had mostly only been able to play during lunch breaks and such. I also was not a big fan of the weapon rentals. While I liked the Ravio character, the game kind of lost something, to me, when I could walk around with nearly every weapon after only the second or third dungeon. And it takes away some from the dungeon's sense of accomplishment when you're not finding and discovering the items in each dungeon. Beyond that, yeah the graphics were nifty and storyline was good. The wall merging was an interesting new mechanic. But overall it was just kind of a let-down.",yes: I recommend this product,,9,13,8 years ago,3.0,4.6818,396

Quantic Dream Collection - PlayStation 4,Sony,There are only TWO good games in this collection.,"To be honest, I really enjoyed Detroit become human, and heavy rain. In both of those titles, you have different protagonists with their own storyline but each time into the overall story and each decision you make for the most part determines the outcome of their own ar to be honest, I really enjoyed Detroit become human, and heavy rain. In both of those titles, you have different protagonists with their own storyline but each time into the overall story and each decision you make for the most part determines the outcome of their own arcs.  While flawed,  these two games are enjoyable and the results are mostly satisfying, the characters evoke strong emotions and it makes some of the odd pacing of the games worth it.  Beyond Two Souls, however, is very confusing.  The controls are awful. The story is convoluted. The characters are for the most part very unlikable.  The first two games mentioned have an overall satisfying reward, despite what ending you get. And beyond to souls, your endings are mostly the same, you get to choose between two options. A lot of your decisions don’t really matter. This is the lesser title of the three. That being said, I think that heavy rain and Detroit become human are both excellent quantic dream titles and therefore it’s worth it to get the collection just so you can play those two.

The bits and pieces of information you can gather early in the game are really intriguing, which made me eager to plow ahead.  But after trying (and failing) the first boss fight 40 or 50 times, it's just not worth it.  I tried the boss solo 10-15 times, and with two others another 30 times or so.  Never got more than about halfway.  Explosive enemies just pop up out of nowhere, with virtually no warning, every few minutes.  I don't understand these games that think ""difficulty"" equals ""fun"" (or ""good"").  It's just absurd.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,For Kids,"As a Zelda fan, I've been very excited for this to come out for about a year when Nintendo was making a big deal over it. When the day finally came, I traded two games towards this. I played it, and I was having a good time. Five days after release, I finished it. I couldn't believe how easy it was. For crying out loud Nintendo, first Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon was too easy and short, and now a ZELDA title?! Where are the development masters from 1998? I honestly don't see why a bunch of people are rating it 10 out of 10. Oh, and did I mention that I beat it in less than 17 HOURS. AND I didn't use a strategy guide or ANY guide. The only reason I haven't gotten rid of it yet is because I want to try to finish the Hero Mode. It's very rage-activating, but that's Hero Mode. I think there's too many giveaways in the dungeons.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,"A great SNES game, an amazing 3DS adaptation!","A Link to the Past was the one game that originally got me to be interested in the Zelda series, so naturally I had to pick up A Link Between Worlds. But what I wasn't expecting was that I would be so entranced by this game, to the point that I would be playing this game for hours on end. By far the best part about this game is its utilization of the 3D in such a beautiful way that, it makes you wonder why aren't all games in 3D. On to game play, I can see how the weapon rental system can get annoying, but I never died in the game so it was never really a bother to me. All of the dungeons are different from its SNES counterpart as to keep you interested in finding a way out. The games soundtrack is amazing. There is so little bad things to say about this game, but if I could say anything it would be two things. Due to the rental system, combat is too easy, you won't find that a boss has a specific weakness to a weapon usually, just your sword works most of the time. Two, also due to the rental system some of the dungeons seem less involved with the specific item needed to get to that dungeon, if I'm going to have to go back to Ravio to get a specific item, I'm going to want to use that item to its fullest.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Awesome Game,Before i started the game i thought it was just a visual upgrade from link to the past but when i started the game the puzzles where brand new the combat was smooth and the story was simple yet enticing. one of my favorite zelda games yet. shut up and take my money nintendo,yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,8 years ago,5.0,4.6818,396
The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Had a fantastic time playing this game!!,Disclaimer I may have missed spelled a lot of things also probably alot of grammar errors. Overall Gameplay: I really enjoyed playing this game with the new mechanic to transform into a moving painting really added a lot of creative ways to go about and move around through a dungeon. One thing I feel is the boss's were a tad bit easy but I didn't really mind it much solving the puzzles and getting through the dungeons using the new mechanic made up for it. Graphics: In my opinion what really makes the game look good is the art style It really makes this game pop some people might dislike the art style I personally love it. Sound: The music is what you could expect from a Zelda game amazing and relaxing and just EPIC. Sound effects in the game are also very good. Lasting Appeal: I myself have played through the game once and still exploring finding many different things I've missed along my journey. I also found myself testing out the streetpass battle system where you fight shadow link and earn rupee's this wont really add any lasting appeal just sort of a fun and easy way of earning money if you can defeat him. In the game there is also these dungeons where your goal is to get treasure by solving the puzzle I'm pretty positive there's no enemy's in these types of so called dungeons. The one mode that tops this off is Hero mode which you unlock after you beat the game the difficulty of the game is heightened I'm now just starting my play through of it from what I know I don't think much is changed except the difficulty of mobs and bosses and I believe you take much more damage per hit. Well I probably left a lot out but anyways I enjoyed this game and I hope other people will to!!! I guess i'll conclude by saying happy holidays!!,yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,8 years ago,5.0,4.6818,396

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,One of the best Zelda games out there,A Link Between Worlds has blown me away with its awesome new characters and style in gameplay.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Nostalgic Tribute to the Best in the Franchise.,"This game pays homage to A Link to the Past in many ways, almost like a direct sequel. It's new, it's sharp, and enjoyable. I was worried at first about the 2D/3D system, but it's masterfully implemented, and causes veteran fans of A Link to the Past to think in new ways. Sometimes it can be a bit easy, but later in the game, it becomes very challenging. More than the challenge, it's unbelievably fun. I consider ALttP to the best LoZ game out there, and this one doesn't disappoint.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,8 years ago,5.0,4.6818,396

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Fantastic! Give it a chance.,"First off, it's a sequel to my favorite Zelda game, so it has a lot to live up to. I think this game is fantastic! Creative puzzles, fantastic music, tough boss battles, and the visuals are a great melding of old and new-school Zelda art styles. If you remember Link to the Past, running around Hyrule will send you on a great nostalgia trip. The item renting system initially bothered me, but I grew to enjoy it, as it allows you to complete the dungeons in any order you see fit. You can buy the weapons you rent for about 800 rupees (some for a little more), but you find money stashed in so many different places that this isn't a problem. There is even a cool upgrade system for the weapons and gear you accumulate. GIVE THE GAME A CHANCE before you complain about the changes made to the standard Zelda formula, as many are doing. I really think any REAL fan of the series will enjoy this game, as well as anyone who appreciates a well put together action adventure game.",yes: I recommend this product,,3,0,8 years ago,5.0,4.6818,396
The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Color of the case is no differant than the game,"Thats right. This game is GOLD. People need to stop complaining that the game is too ''easy'' or the dungeons are to ''easy''. Why don't people actually pay attention to the game play? The game has a unique and breathtaking experience. You can go IN walls, and walk while you are in one, to help you get places. In the dungeons, you need to merge into the walls and go to another corner to get to a platform, to get to some stairs that were out of reach before. There are also new weapons such as
- the sand rod
- the tornado rod
- the ice rod
and the fire rod.
The music is stunning, (in a good way) it is done by a different composer than previous Zelda games, but thankfully, they picked a good one. The Lasting appeal takes so long before it goes away. A lot of people have been saying this game is worse than previous Zelda games, that things have changed, but in my opinion, video games can't always be the same thing, over and over again, and that it IS good to change. Thats something that a lot of gamers don't get these days. Sometimes, video games need to be worth their color. Gold.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,8 years ago,5.0,4.6818,396
The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,A piece of art,"The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is none other than a beautiful experience that every gamer must play. Here are 10 reasons why you must have this game. 1. Music- The soundtrack in this game is absolutely gorgeous. From epic tracks to soft tracks, this is one of the best sounding Zelda games. 2. The characters- In all Zelda games the characters you meet along your journey are always memorable, and this game is no exception. From the evil and sure of himself villain, to the princess of the dark kingdom of Lorule, all the way to the weird yet awesome shop keeper, you will find yourself truly connecting with the characters of this game in every sense. 3. The story- Though not deep enough to make you cry, the story throughout the game is fantastic and perfectly well paced. 4. Freedom in exploration- Over the years Zelda games have become very strict in the sense that you go to this dungeon an then that dungeon. In this new adventure you decide where you want to explore in any order you want. This brings me to the next reason; 5. New way to play- In this adventure instead of you getting key items in dungeons, you'll be able to get all of them for a high price soon after you begin your quest. This allows you to explore the land and solving puzzles at any time you would like to. 6. The action- Like all Zelda's you are Link with you sword, shield, and other weapons. This game is no exception with it's spot on gameplay that's as fun as heck to beat the enemies with. 7. Wall morning....or whatever it's called- In this installment you'll be able to ride along side the walls to get to places you never could in order to solve puzzles and find items. This adds a tremendous amount of new fun experiences to the game that I never felt before in any Zelda title. This new ability is truly unique 8. The puzzles- With every dungeon...there must be puzzles to keep you from moving forward, and this game has some of the best I've solved in a long time. Using your items, smarts, and new wall morphing ability, this game is packed with really fun, clever, and (only some) difficult puzzle solving. 9. I don't have a number 9 so let's move on to number 10. 10. Zelda- Let me remind you, this is a Legend of Zelda title.......WHY WOULDN'T YOU BUY IT!?!?!?! Okay now to the final question you read this whole review to get an answer to which is, should you but this game and is it worth buying a 3ds for.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,Way overhyped,"Okay I am a hardcore Zelda fan but this game was highly disappointing. The dungeons are the smallest of any zelda game, even Minish Cap had larger dungeons. The ending although is the best ending of any zelda title since it is good vs. good a great break away from the usual Zelda games. Although the final boss was way to easy. The baseball minigame was utterly boring and near impossible to control. The fact that bombs and arrows are infinite is just plain ridiculous if they did a combination of finite arrows & bombs and they used the stamina meter it would have been more challenging. Hero mode certainly makes the game a bit harder but it isn't that difficult.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Nintendo 3DS,Nintendo,A real disappointment to a LoZ longtime player,"This game has been effectively dumbed down. The dungeons are cake, the monsters are cake, the puzzles are cake. It's as if the game developers gave up on the long time tradition of making a long lasting challenging and replayable game. For a game of 40 dollars I feel as if the cost of each entertainment hour is not matched. The rental of the equipment is a good idea, especially since if you're 10+ you probably won't die. Yet that's something that seems awry in the gameplay. Maybe I was expecting another great LoZ game like Twilight Princess, even Skyward Sword was awesome. The remake of OoT was challenging and exciting, with great graphics and gameplay style.

Quantic Dream Collection - PlayStation 4,Sony,Detroit human is something special!,"Heavy rain was a leading game of its time, the graphics are updated but the game is aging difficultly. Beyond is a game with mixed concepts although intriguing it can be hindered by game mechanics. Detroit human is where this five star rating is a must. This game is beautiful, crisp, and you never know when the decision you'll make will change lives. Peace or war, obey or freedom, sacrifice or living to fight another day. It's an amazing game where each character draws you in in different ways making you question truly what the best decision for yourself and or for everyone else is. The concept of an aware AI has been in our eye sight for years, but this game touches on the heart of it and demands the player to choose where they stand. The draw backs would be the occasional forced story line where the choice you would make isn't an option, lack of tutorial leaves the occasional negative consequences when an action was missed and lastly the game mechanics and view screen can on occasion leave you struggling to get your bearings. BUT in all honesty these things are so minor. The ending left me wishing they'd given us more but I see room for a second game and only hope the story just might continue. Overall this game left me emotionally ragged in all the ups and downs my people went through, along with making me really feel and know every action could save or kill my character.

Joe Hartsock or ""Red"" is a careing squad leader who would do anything just to get his men home in one piece. But he realizes that he cant save anyone so he thinks he's there to shorten the casualties. You have to take your men are part of the legendary 101st Airborne. You'll need tactical excellence to get through this game. But you also need to care for your men because you will need them to help you and if they die you have no chance so keep them alive!",yes: I recommend this product,,2,2,13 years ago,5.0,5.0,1

The dance moves are usually the same as in the videos, also you can unlock little dance videos from MJ's choreographers, or people who just downright danced for the game. What I always find funny is looking at the legs of the in game dancers because those were videotaped with photoshopped glow around it.

I was born and raised on Mario, most I got out of story was ""bad man capture princess, go rescue princess"", but what I remember is an amazing sight, I won't spoil any of it, but when I eventually go back through and see Reshiram on my ds again it will be a delight to hear the title theme, rival theme, gym battle theme, gym battle last Pokémon theme, and jam out to the low health theme, I'm serious they took the *doo doo- doo doo- doo doo- doo doo-* and turned it into an entire bop.

Battlefield 1,Electronic Arts,Needs improvements,The overall concept of the game is good; I do like how the game comes with new features like the bayonet charge. I also like the options of a vehicle having the capability of holding a lot of people. What I do not like is the game is full of glitches. This is not a well-polished game at all. It leaves a lot to be desired. If you have a FPS that you already like and know this may not be a good choice for you. The vehicles being able to carry multiple passengers are the only good feature about them. The viewing angles are awful and while this might be historically correct is does not make for good game play. Shotguns are ridiculously over powered! People one shot from halfway across the map as well as handgun sniping seems to be happening too. I don’t know if this a cheating issue or a skill issue. The last point I would make is that all the servers have very low Tic counts. This can make for some very short games. More load time then actual play time. I would only recommend this game if you are looking for a game that takes place during this time period or you would want a FPS while not having one that is current.,No: I don’t recommend this product,,2,13,5 years ago,2.0,3.5556,9

The games campaign is quite an experience with action packed scenes and thought out storyline. The playstyle is similar to bf3 and 4 but has some really outstanding additions to the game. The only bad part that is standing because it was just released... The multiplayer is not balanced, I feel as though the game gives you the WORST weapons to start off with; It's understandable to give beginners OK weapons but the ones you receive are absolute garbage. Also at the moment some of the aiming for non single fire/ Bolt action is slightly off, missing shots when you know you hit them.

Been looking to get an extra copy of the game for some time. Black was my first game, and I have always adored it.

Michael Jackson The Experience - Nintendo Wii,Ubisoft,What a Joke!!!,"I picked this game up just for the heck of it yesterday and let me tell you that my family and I were hugely disappointed in the approach used to make it! Even my kids were not very interested in it after very long! The whole game and everything about it is flawed. My whole family is hugely into Michael Jackson and if he was still alive to see this horrible game he'd sue the heck out of UbiSoft for trying to attach his name to it just for it not meeting his expectations alone! It does have alot of songs which is nice and yes they are his but whats so annoyingly awful about the about the whole thing is that the character is more like a cartoony silhouette that was mapped over someone whom only knew half of Michael Jackson's Moves. The MJ Training Videos are only like 10 seconds long and tell you absolutely nothing that you didn't know before! The dancing part is focused more on your hands which is understandable because of the Wii Remote but that is still no excuse for the Lousy Dancing used in the game because everybody knows that Michael was always about fancy-footwork! Alot of the dancing doesn't even match the original dancing done by Michael and appears like somebody just winged it pretending to be him simply because they got paid to do so. The game is just a huge wasted effort! This is NOT a game I would recommend to anyone and neither would Michael Jackson himself. Anyone that truely adores him should steer clear of this horrible waste of time game that attempts to take on Michael's Name because it simply isn't even worthy enough of it and don't even get me started on the Kinect Version, it's even worse!",No: I don’t recommend this product,,2,27,11 years ago,2.0,4.3975,239

Michael Jackson The Experience - Nintendo Wii,Ubisoft,The most fun we've had in a long time.,"We brought this game home with our Wii -- it was one of the two games that made the family decide to even get that console! -- and popped it in pretty quickly. After dancing to one song, even my mother, who truly isn't a fan of video games in any shape or form except for the occasional arcade-style game, wanted to play. We managed to spend almost three hours just having sheer FUN with this, trying out the songs, dancing along, singing, whatever.

It has to be, as the review ""title"" says, the most fun any of us has had in who knows how long. Mom says that even when she used to dance at bars with my dad on the weekends, from the time it opened to the time it closed, it wasn't near as much as this, and I think I can compare it to my box-playing days, back when leaves were the big thing, you know? It's a great family game, lyrics and song content somewhat aside, and as long as you can have fun? You barely even realize that you're getting tired. Dancing like this is some of the best exercise available, I think, and if the Just Dance games are anything at all CLOSE to this, we'll be picking them up as soon as possible. It's probably the best investment we've made for the family in some time, and that's saying something. If we could give it a score higher than ten, we would.

On a more detailed note, the game reads the controllers surprisingly well -- you truly have to have fun dancing, you can't just move your arms; it reacts to your overall motion, which I've heard some dance games fail miserably at -- the graphics are very easy on the eyes, which could make or break a game; the concept is simple and addictive (there are no trick levels or anything like that, just dance routines that you may need practice to pass accurately); and even though the tracks are all from the same artist, there actually is very little concern about the replay value dropping (something I was seriously worried about!), as there are so many catchy tracks that it's not even a question. It's a hard game, but in a great way - you're not ready to smash the controller, ever - and really, it's so balanced that it's going to be hard to beat as games go on. if they ever make a sequel sort of thing, we'll be one of the first lined up to grab it.",yes: I recommend this product,,7,0,11 years ago,5.0,4.3975,239

Yea it is made by the same ppl as just dance but i like it way better. you can choose to be either the back dancer, MJ, dance partner with their own difficulty.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,A good waste of my time.,"Hello, I had previously ordered Pokemon Black.  There was a guarantee on the game so I wasn't necessarily worried about it working or not.  I waited about 4-5 days for delivery (no big deal there) and when I got it, the back of the actual game (where you can see the ""teeth"") looked to be almost rusted or degraded so badly that my 3DS couldn't even read the game.  So I had waited 4-5 days for nothing and had to drive half an hour to the nearest GameStop to do an exchange.  The staff were super friendly and patient about my issue but it still kind of stinks that I had the issue in the first place.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,My favorite Pokemon game... EVER!,"Not only was this the first Pokemon game I was truly interested in as a kid, but I continue to love it to this day. I've played the game over eight times, each time training unique new Pokemon from the Unova region. On top of the new and fascinating Pokemon from Pokemon Black came a very compelling story that has defined the Pokemon world. The story challenges the ethics of capturing Pokemon led by the nefarious Team Plasma, serving under the Seven Sages and Lord Ghetsis. Ghetsis also seeks to gain more power and capture the Pokemon himself, so he trains a boy named N who eventually becomes the King of Team Plasma. N is an especially remarkable character in the Pokemon universe because his developments as a character left us all loving him even more. I absolutely love this game and it has defined my love for Pokemon from the beginning. From the amazing story, to the awesome gym leaders, to the beautiful towns and cities, Pokemon Black offers so much for players that is an absolute must have.",yes: I recommend this product,,60,2,5 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553
Michael Jackson The Experience - Nintendo Wii,Ubisoft,Perfect MJ Tribute,"Got the game on the day the preorder shipped, and I am thoroughly pleased with the game.

It plays well, albeit a bit too reliant on perfect motions, and really gets you into it.

The song selection is vast, and the entertainment value is high.

You get to pick whether you want to follow MJ's choreography, or the back up dancers, and it gives you a difficult for both.

The only real thing I didn't like about this game was it's lack of a tutorial. There is no way to learn how to play, other than simply playing. You catch on fast, but it would have been nice to have one.

All in all, the game is a good one, and I will be playing it for a long time, I'm sure.",yes: I recommend this product,,6,7,11 years ago,4.0,4.3975,239

The story in Pokemon black is a really fun and interesting, it's about a team trying to take away Pokemon from all trainers but i'm not going to talk too much about that, the story is not too long or too short. 1 of the problems I hate about this game is most Pokemon look weird I know it's not a new thing but they should improve. The gameplay is AWESOME they changed some of the battling moves so they look cooler now and sometimes when you are playing the camera turns in different angles so it doesn't feel like some blocky world. A other problem is when you finish the story you don't really have nothing to do except catching them all but there isn't that much Pokemon unlike the other games.

The Pokémons are also cool and creative don't let the annoying Gen 1 fanboys trick you.

I would recommend this edition over the original because you will receive all the DLC that's available for the game. However being a DC Comics fan for a majority of my life, I have to wonder why they used Batgirl and General Zod. Quite honestly, Batgirl and Batman are basically the same except for genders and Superman and General Zod are basically they same so why use them instead of adding something new and fresh like Swamp Thing or even Killer Croc (even though I hate how many batman characters were put into this game). The skins are incredible and were used from multiple different storylines throughout the DC Universe such as Blackest and DC's new 52. The campaign was good (people who don't know the storyline would say incredible) and was entertaining. The campaign lasts around 5-6 hours but for a fighting game that's not too bad.

Don't get me wrong this game is good despite my rating but as an avid Pokemaniac I felt it didn't compare to the other games.

In my opinion, each game gets better and better, and will only continue to do so. The originals will always be special to those of us who grew up with them, but it's very obvious that the graphics and overall lasting appeal of Pokemon Black far surpass them.

Pros: New places to explore and Pokemon to catch, while retaining the aspects of the original games that made them so famous. There's always something to do, even after playing through the basic storyline.
Cons: I tend to play with the sound off, because this is one area where all Pokemon games continue to need improvement. Better background music, PLEASE!",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,8 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553
Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Not My Favorite,"Ok, before you hate me, i am in no way trashing this game. It is still a good pokemon game. But this has to be my least favorite version. I have been playing pokemon ever since red version first came out, and have played every version since. I had been waiting a long time for new pokemon to appear, and when i saw the announcement, i was excited! I got the game a little bit after it came out. There were some things i loved that they added, and some that i hated. Here is a list of my pros and cons:

Pros: Good story line
Beautiful cut scenes
cool environments
pokemon move in battle
mechanics were greatly improved

Cons:
Pokemon are VERY pixelated. (I know pokemon hasn't ever been about graphics, but its hard to tell what your pokemon even looks like in battle. This was the first thing i noticed whenever i started playing)

Pokemon are very uncreative. (Some pokemon do look pretty cool, but i noticed that a lot of them were based off of previous pokemon. Such as the one that looks like tauros in the first generation, and the one that looks like luvdisc from the third generation.)

Story is shorter compared to the others

Few things to accomplish after you beat the story.

For the first time since i have been playing Pokemon, i do not want to buy the next version in the series (Black and White 2) (i see the same problems) However, i will return when X and Y come out. Those look pretty awesome! My favorite versions are still emerald version, and heart gold version.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Pokemon is back in fashion!,"Pokemon is my childhood. I played almost every game made, I watched the Anime until it got up to Diamond and Pearl (trust me the anime is horrible here recently!), and I even have a plush Pikachu! ^_^ All nerdyness aside *ahem* Pokemon Black is a great way to either start out in the series as a newcomer, or renew your faith in the ever popular franchise. I like the game all the way through from the animation, to the battles, to the little details they added within the game. I don't like the fact that rotation battles were not as frequent as it could have been, but they were fun nontheless. Hopefully in Black 2 they will have it more often. Also, I have beaten the game today, but they still have more story and Pokemon to go. It never ends!!!",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,9 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553
Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Great Gameplay Improvements,"As far as basic gameplay and story go, this is the same as any other Pokémon game. Your character receives a pokémon, goes on an adventure to catch other pokémon, and on the way makes friends, battles other trainers, and defeats enemies. The character designs are interesting as always, the locations are nice to look at and fun to explore, and the new pokémon are well-designed for the most part.

Perhaps it was the way I built my team, but I noticed that the gym battles were much more challenging than they had been in the last generation. This was a nice change, because strategy played much more of a part in these battles than luck or elemental advantages. The post-storyline quests and regions are also larger, and even after many hours of gameplay I haven't yet done everything available to me.

This game really makes good use of the DS' connective capabilities. The Global Link is an inventive and refreshing addition to gameplay. The other online features are easier to use than ever, making the game more social than previous installments were.

One other vast improvement to the game is the soundtrack. Having played all generations except HeartGold/SoulSilver, I can honestly say that this game was the first one I can remember listening to all the way through. The annoying beeping when a pokémon reaches low health has been integrated into its own song. It is no longer repetitive and headache-inducing, but pleasant.

While not my favorite of the franchise, this game introduces great new features and improves on old ones, guaranteeing a bright future for other Pokémon games to come.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,9 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553
Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,"By far, my most favorite Pokemon version.","I have been playing this series since Red & Blue, about 13-14 years later I still am an active player of these games. I had gotten this game as a gift the day it came out and personally didn't know what to think of it. I chose the Fire Starter for once and began my journey in this new region. To this day, I have clocked in over 120 hours on my Black version. I have never loved a Pokemon game as much as this. The soundtrack is brilliant, the characters are so unique and the bonus features, such as the Dream World and the Battle Subway are outstanding. I highly reccomend this game to all Pokemon lovers.

WWE 2K19 - PlayStation 4,2K Games,One of the worst games of all time,"I usually love wrestling games but this is seriously one of the worst games ever made. The gameplay is just horrible, your punches will just go through people, constant glitches that ruin the gameplay, extremely slow cut scenes during game play that can still be interrupted by the computer player, if you try to run a certain direction half the time it makes you run the other direction first, and then there’s the IA reversal that just sucks. The computer reverses way too much even on easy difficulty but you can’t reverse a reversal, so gameplay is extremely frustrating and not fun. Anything you try to do will either miss or be reversed and the computer will just attack you during a cut scene that you can’t get out of. Terrible slow gameplay for the player with too much skill for the computer. The only game I’ve played worse than this is 2k20…",No: I don’t recommend this product,,0,0,14 days ago,1.0,4.2351,1195

Also new to the Pokemon games is the Pokemon Musical in Nimbasa City where you can put your Pokemon in the spotlight and have them dance with interactable props to help you score high with the audience, also with wireless communications you may play with friends to see who is better at musicals. Pokemon Black and White also feature he brand new Battle Subway feature where just like the Battle Tower in previous games, the Battle Subway lets you team up with the opposite gender of your charecter you may battle through multiple trainers for battle points to get special items from potions to rare candy even though the 3D graphics are a bit shabby I give this game 2 thumbs up.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,9 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553
Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,"5th Generation, Quite Good","Although the earlier generations (specifically 1-3) were always the high point of Pokemon, this newest installment enhances so many things, adding new items for strategies, new moves for setting up sweeps (Quiver Dance on Volcarona), and all-around very useful Pokemon in competitive battling. Although the main story is not too deep, it doesn't have to be; you play this game to train up a team and defeat your friends! The Wi-Fi battling experience was also greatly improved in this game, much better than PBR, and trading is done right now by being able to select Pokemon from your PC and negotiations online. And if you need experience to train, you can get plenty of experience by defeating Audino in rustling grass, they have the highest EXP giveaway ratio of Pokemon in the game, and good also if you for some reason need HP EVs, but if you've finished EV training, it's a great way to speed up the leveling process, I've gotten two Pokemon to Lv100 in just a few hours of concentrated play.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Best Pokemon game so far.,"This game was definitely my favorite Pokemon game to date. The plot was absolutely amazing (a plot in a pokemon game???) and the main game ending was a real shocker. The gym leaders were fun, and *some* of the new Pokemon were really awesome. The post-game kept me playing a lot as well. However, I thought the game was too easy and also too straightforward. I never had to try a ton of times to beat a gym leader, and I got through the Pokemon League on my 2nd try. Also, some of the Pokemon were just ripoffs of old pokemon that didn't make an appearance in the main game (like Woobat and Zubat, Roggenrolla and Geodude), but it is still an amazing game and I think that it would be a great addition to anyone's gaming collection.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,9 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553
Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Waay too easy and boring.,"I like this game alot, but I've played just about every pokemon game and can say that this is the worse of them all. First of all, It's too easy: Each starter is suppose to correspond with the 3 difficulty levels(easy-medium-hard). Trainers in each city use just about the same few pathetic pokemon, and wild pokemon repeat too much as appose to the other games where the pokemon repeated but not to such an annoying point. The game also provides a ridiculous amount of healing sources/items, and it constantly reminds you what pokemon types the gyms use..that's unnecessary. Second, It's just completely boring. There are no mini-games to play like in D&P, the soundtrack is nothing new, and over half the pokemon themselves are just quickly made and ugly.(Im not the only one who thinks so) Overall, B&W seem to have been made for people who just discovered that pokemon exists. I only recommend this to noobies, people who just want to play with new pokemon, or people who want to be prepared for B&W 2 which hopefully are like D&P. Other than that, I'd have to say get Diamond or Pearl, because they have none of these problems.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,3,6,9 years ago,3.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Pro's and Cons!,"This is actually the first Pokemon game I've played in a while. Ever since playing Pokemon Diamond and most of the GBA games which were good but the story often got either frustrating and or respetive for me. I'm pretty happy I bought Pokemon Black to me it's the best out of any Pokemon game I've played, but there are some equally frustrating things about this one. Cons: One of the biggest problems I'm having with this game and the reason why I only gave it a average rating was because the new Pokemon are a nightmare! Not only are they not creative such as Wubat (who had me laughing for hours because it was such a rip-off of Zubat) but they are really weak! I found myself having real difficulties with beating anything after my 4th gym badge. I mean seriously my starter Pokemon Tepig; who is said to be the best out of the two other starters is in 2nd evolution level 35 and is losing to wild animals of level 22!! whats up with that!? Which believe me is SOOO frustrating!!! and for some reason they decided to pix-elate the Pokemon so the pokemon look like they did in the Gameboy Advance games which isn't horrible but they just leave you thinking why? Pro's: The pro's of the game is that the game settings are amazing! and unlike the Pokemon are so creative and just so fun to explore! The game also has lots of opportunities to help your Pokemon advance levels which would of been great except the Pokemon are really weak so it doesn't help much. Also I love that they didn't make the gym leaders ridiculously hard like they always do in the previous Pokemon games. In conclusion the settings and places in this game is great, the Pokemon not so great. So if you can stand always running back in forth from forest to health center throughout the game then I would recommend it! BUT If you get frustrated with things like that like I do you might want to wait and buy Pokemon Black 2 (which i'm totally getting) because they are bringing back the the good Pokemon generations as well as the new ones in this game and hopefully with all the new settings and places like this one:)",yes: I recommend this product,,3,4,9 years ago,3.0,4.4195,553
Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Pokemon's Last Stand?,"To be honest I was expecting more from this game, but I find myself enjoying the older versions more and finding myself putting this game away to collect dust. Whenever I pick it up now I hesitate on even playing it. The pokemon are beginning to look too weird to me, and I was dissapointed for the ending (but the end credit's music was kinda cool ;p). Thanks to this game I realized that I can enjoy only the older versions, because that was what I truly enjoyed when I was a kid. I cannot feel that enjoyment coming out of these newer games. Don't get me wrong there are some cool wifi and wireless stuff on these new games, but they are not meant for Pokemon. I'm beginning to wonder if this is the last pokemon generation that Nintendo's making.

I understand that it's hard naming and creating pokemon, so the originals will obviously be the best, but besides that it did very well.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,"Great game, very addictive. But slow at the end","Overall, excellent game. Most people have been saying how the new pokemon are pathetic, but i disagree. At first, i thought that they looked pretty stupid and would be pretty bad for a team, but i quickly learned to love them as i discovered more i didnt know were in the game. I agree, nintendo COULD have come up with better, but overall they did a great job. I have some new favorites from this game. But for gameplay, also great. True its the same old point of every pokemon game, catch all the pokemon and fill out the pokedex and become champion, but with all the new things they added (new moves, abilities, and battle styles), it sure turned that into a pretty neat twist. And the way I play pokemon games, the game could last me forever. But if your younger or getting it for a younger kid, it would end pretty quickly after the game is complete. Now for the downsides. Personally, i hated how they didnt add ANY of the new pokemon from previous generations. If this is your first pokemon experience, its all good and wont effect you, but for those who have played it before will be disappointed. And after completing the game, there isnt much to do after except for battling. No more story or anything. But what i did like is how they changed the wifi connections with the game. With previous pokemon DS titles, i couldnt connect the game to wifi because of the way the wifi was locked to specific connections. But they updated it so now it can connect to my wifi and is able to connect with all connections. So now im able to use all the wifi features in the game, which are great! So my overall conclusion is great game. I love what they added and some of the things they took out. With 3D graphics, a lengthy game, neat new pokemon, story line, and awesome new features, i say nintendo could have done a lot better, but still made something good and worthy to get.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,9 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553

I love the online trading center it makes your life so much easier when it comes to collecting all the pokemon after the game is done, the pokemon could be a little more original but who cares, your first goal is to conquer all the gyms and then think about the details of pokemon later this game was simply great, but i do wish i got white instead because zekrom is one of the coolest pokemon ever!",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,9 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Many of the pokemon are basically remakes of previous ones, like woobat, seriously, it even rhymes with zubat! They need to get some more creativity in it next time. They should have gone ahead and remade ruby and sapphire before making a whole new game if they knew it would turn out like this. Though the story has been rather good so far, and the music for the team Plasma battles is awesome.",yes: I recommend this product,,6,9,9 years ago,2.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Geared toward novice players,"Pokemon Black Version is the companion to Pokemon White Version, the fifth generation Pokemon games. This fifth generation game really delivers the standard Pokemon experience. As I said, this game is geared toward novice players who are new to the series. Some of the features that can show you this can also really enhance the gameplay for anyone. The text moves faster, the Pokemon attack faster, and some more things to really enhance the gameplay. It's the little things that make the game more fun. But perhaps the biggest thing to make the game easy to pick up and play for anyone is that Pokemon gain so much more experience per battle that it makes level-grinding obsolete, which is a good feeling. Switch training is also still very effective for training many Pokemon at once. If a Pokemon has a status ailment, it will show it on the pokemon's body, like if the Pokemon is asleep the sprite's eyes close to show that it's asleep. Parts of the game stray away from that isometric viewpoint that many Pokemon veterans are used to, and make use of full 3D. The best examples of this are on the Skyarrow Bridge and in Castelia City. That alone makes the game so much more enjoyable. The music is overall not that great, but there are some songs in the game that are so good, they make up for all the bad ones. The following isn't anything new to me, but I think the female sprite is just hot. What can I say? Pokemon girls are hot. Pokemon Black is a great game. Good graphics, decent music, and the small things have been improved that just make the game more enjoyable. It may be a bit too easy for a Pokemon veteran, but this game is still very easy to recommend to anyone, whether you are a Pokemon veteran or new to the series. Buy it now.",yes: I recommend this product,,7,0,9 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553

However the gameplay is excellent and the graphics is looking good since the ps1 days and its been a long time.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,A Very good Pokemon game.,"The Pokemon series has kept to its roots for more than ten years, remaining a rock/paper/scissor-type RPG. With this very basic format comes with additional features, graphical improvements, and unfortunately, some negative things as well.

Don't mistake me for saying this game is bad - it is indeed a superb game. I would like to cover each aspect of the game.

We start off with the gameplay. It seems rather simplistic; water beats fire, fire beats grass, and so forth. Each pokemon you own can learn up to four moves, and moves are divided into physical, special, and stat. Moves are also divided into 17 elemental types, much like the pokemon. With these moves, you are to lower the opponent pokemon's HP to 0. Certain moves, known as HMs, are needed to access areas you couldn't access prior. Fortunately, for those who don't like using HM slaves, they are not required to proceed in the storyline, save for one instance.

As for the story, you are a boy/girl of around 14-16 years of age, with two friends Cheren and Bianca. The three of you are about to receive your first pokemon from Professor Juniper(who also happens to be the first female professor in the mainstream Pokemon games). With your pokemon, you will be setting out not only on a journey to defeat the pokemon league and claim the title of champion, but to be acknowledged as full-fledged adults, which makes sense, considering your character's age. Along your journey, you will be encountering Team Plasma, an organization striving to separate pokemon from humans. You, of course, are against this ludicrous ideal, and things become more serious.

As for graphics, 2D sprites don't really go well with 3D environments. But it's a nice step towards making 3D handheld games more detailed.

There are a few additional features, like the Pokemon Musical, and the C-Gear, but I'll leave you to try those yourself. These add to the lasting appeal, but because the Unova region is so linear(removing a lot of backtracking unlike other pokemon games), it still feels a little neutered.

Overall, this is a great pokemon game, like all other mainstream pokemon games, and I'm sure you will enjoy this game.

If you're in doubt, though, try giving it a rental first.",yes: I recommend this product,,3,1,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

WWE 2K19 - PlayStation 4,2K Games,I'm going to stick with the older wrestling games.,"As someone who's used to playing the older wrestling games I'm not a fan of how this the game feels. The wrestlers movement is slow and it sometimes it seems sluggish. The grappling system seems slow, the reversal system is bad (the idea of exact timing and requiring stamina make reversing moves difficult when compared to previous wwe games), and the only time a message pops up for your tutorial is after you've already done something which means you have to discover the game controls for yourself. That makes performing more advanced moves and features difficult. I found that career mode / My Player mode is also lacking. The storyline seems boring and the only choices that you make in the game are insignificant. In older wrestling games for season mode you could decide whether to be a singles competitor or a tag team competitor or who you wanted to form an alliance with but for this game you just create a generic character and get put through a predictable storyline. (I guess I'm a fan of a more open-world style career mode which this game is not) The only redeemable part of this game is its roster. It has wrestlers from the past and present.",No: I don’t recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,1,1,2 years ago,2.0,4.2351,1195

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,"Game lasts long, just play it correctly!","First off, reviews are saying you beat the game in a few days. True. But if you play the game correctly-- complete your Pokédex, go to the Dream World, train more Pokémon, possibly battle or trade on the GTS, and even more... then there is PLENTY of more fun bound to happen on this game! :) The story-line is pretty neat. It's a little predictable, but I loved it anyway. The graphics are awesome. Especially when completing the story and seeing the older generation Pokémon using moves against others.

The story was kinda short, too. I finished it in 2 days, but other people finish it quicker somehow. I'm also depressed that I didn't get White instead because of 1. Version exclusive Pokemon and 2. The White Forest. I would recomend this to a friend, though.

Yakuza: Like a Dragon Day One Edition - Xbox One,SEGA,Wasn't ready for this game to be this good...,"LOVE IT, get it, play it, get addicted. I also bought new COD & Assassins Creed and I have only played this game since opening it, leaving the other games to sit. It's like playing a crime-set soap opera. The story (VERY deep), the character development, are great. Humor is the classic cheesy humor in Yakuza games but it's delightful. Fights can get repetitive but they thought about that by giving us jobs to chose from to mix things up to keep you engaged. You are given the controls to become a full blown capitalist (one of my favorite parts of the game as it reflects my profession) Has lots of Easter eggs to the Pokémon world too but I'll let you find them in game... HIGHLY recommend playing through in it's natural Japanese voice setting, it's okay to read kids, and much less corny ALTHOUGH this is a HUGE improvement for Sega & English speaking characters (Shenmue 2 for reference, woof) the English speaking setting is much better and translates over a bit more but you can't be more authentic then speaking Japanese so do it. You do not need to be a Yukuza series fan to enjoy this game. Kasuga is a new character to a new world in a next generation of gaming. Get this.

I've always loved pokemon and to me the older versions are better because they bring back so many memories. i really prefer pokemon black over white because i believe reshiram is stronger than zekrom.,yes: I recommend this product,,6,2,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553
Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Overall Good.,"I reserved this game and got it the morning it was released and from the moment i played i was drawn into its new landscape and the overall story. However Some of the creatures they choose are rather poor with certain ones but there are some i just was in awe of. I loved that there where more 3-D effects while traveling and in battle along with a few more areas. If your a seasoned pokemon fan and have been since the begining then you will find this game rather easy to beat, but it is still a fun installment in the series.",yes: I recommend this product,,4,2,10 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Near perfect,"I picked up this game (first game for DS) only having played the older Pokemon Red/Blue and Yellow. I'm not a BIG fan of Pokemon but a really big RPG fan. I loved this game. The story really had me going till the end. I loved collecting all the different types of Pokemon, grant it some seemed a little childish but it was really in depth. Only problem once I beat the story I got burnt out and had to take a break before trying to catch all the Pokemon in the game. Other than that it is a really awesome RPG. I pretty much made this review for the people who are looking for a good RPG and do not know much about Pokemon and the series. Must buy epic RPG getting all new ones coming out.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,1,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Very excellent game,"It's really nice to see how much Pokemon has gone through and how much it's changed. From the beginning with Pokemon versions Blue and Red, all the way to this. Pokemon may have been a laughing stock to some people who are too ""cool"" to play it, or even look at it, but, when this was released, a lot of people were talking about it. ... And now, onto the review, overall, this game was REALLY great, it had really good sound, music, gameplay, etc. However, there's a little thing that might be ugly at first, but then you wont recognize it. And that thing is the zoomed in sprites of your pokemon in the battle, it looks pretty pixelated and unappealing, but, you'll hardly notice it.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Once you finish that you can access Mini games which are way fun to do.. and Puzzle games.. Also zen garden which is cool... You also get money which you can spend at crazy daves to upgrade stuff... There is an online play I believe where you can view peoples houses and stuff, I am not sure because I haven't tried anything out... Also there is a coop and vs mode.. where you can play as zombies... Also in adventure mode two people can battle together.. Plus you get two games peggle and zuma.. what's not to love?

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,It's as revolutionary as Gen II[That's good],"Alright, I did enjoy Black. When I first heard about it, I was going ""YES! YES!"" Then, after a little while, I was thinking it'd be roughly the same as any other Pokemon game, save for the Unova Region's quirks.

At long last, I got the game on the 14th, and I've enjoyed it since. I must say, the Global Link is a great idea, something that I'm glad they implemented this Generation. Use of WPA Wi-Fi[for us DSi-Users] means less dropped battles and trades, the GTS resemble the one introduced in HG/SS, and I love the Random Match-Up![yet another feature I've long-awaited!] The graphics look great, as are the movements, similar to the ones introduced in Stadium, and every other Home-Console spin-off. The Battle Subway is quite unique, in my opinion, and I love how much attention they devoted to the trains alone![I'm a fan of trains]

Alright, there are a few cons though, but nothing major.

-Not every Pokemon can be seen or captured until Nintendo releases an Event. Japan has had a bunch so far, mainly Dream World, but everywhere else lacks Events to introduce the remaining few Pokemon unavailable.[can you say Keldeo?]

-Pixelation. The idle-movements of Pokemon are awesome, but, it doesn't look to great on some, if they're on your team. For example, Rapidash looks awesome, as the pixels are moving fast with the fire-effect. However, Zapdos looks somewhat distorted from the back.

-Connection. I love how the C-Gear teases me whenever it finds a signal, but I'm still required to go to DSi Settings, and configure it to work. Not funny, C-Gear.

-Story Length. Nintendo seems to want to emphasize connectivity even more. The Single Player Adventure isn't as long as it was in Crystal, for instance. Granted, there's so much to do afterwards, but still, I'd have liked a little more conflict with Team Plasma.

-Lack of a Move Tutor. Why Nintendo, why? This could have made Sweet Hearts more useful, rather than just restoring 20hp! Think of the Shards system in D/P/Plt.

-Names. Alright, this i a low blow, but... Ducklett? REALLY? Nintendo, you failed on some of the names. Thank goodness we can still Nickname them. -.-

As for Pros...[in addition to everything stated earlier]

-Pokedex. The Pokedex now is more 'accurate', let's say. For example, if you catch or see a Shiny Patrat[why you would WANT a Patrat to begin with is beyond me], it will record it as shiny.

-Graphics. This ought to shut up those who say the Pokemon series has terrible graphics. The Pokemon Series has never been about graphics, but Nintendo updated them because that's all gamers think about these days.

-Music. Another definite win for Ninty, the music is greatly improved, as usual. There are so many memorable themes, with the hidden options in some areas to add sound.

-Connectivity. We're using Infrared again, which is great, because it means I don't have to fly or walk to a town, just to save and wait for it to connect. Swapping Friend Codes is much easier too.

-Version differences. This makes it more necessary to trade with White[since this is a Black review] than with the Counter-Versions in past Generation, than for just a few Pokemon. White has more Pokemon, while Black has more items. So, you'll be hoping to find someone to get you a few little Pokemon from White Forest in exchange for some Fire Stones from Black City.

-Seasons. Another update from Gen II, we now have Seasons. This affects the terrain, the Pokemon that appear, and makes an otherwise uninteresting Pokemon unique.

That's about it, enjoy the game!",yes: I recommend this product,,15,1,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,A Great Last Game to the DS,"This was the last game for the DS to some. The 3DS was about a month away, and no one could wait. But Nintendo pulled out a new Pokemon main series game to end the DS off, and we had no problem waiting another month for the 3DS. This game, in my opinion, is what Pokemon Diamand and Pearl should have been. It actually boosted up the graphics, made the Pokemon always moving, added a new camera view (both in battle and out), and made online play accessable. Plus the game has a lot of content... including 150 ALL NEW Pokemon. So... let's get on with the review. -----GRAPHICS------ Nothing ground-breaking, but they still look very nice, and the animations are great! -----FEATURES----- The game features 150 new Pokemon. That might be enough to make you want to buy this game. Plus there is a whole new region to explore with new cities, characters, and a whole new dramatic story. Plus all of the Pokemon from past versions are able to be caught or traded after the main game is over... so replay value is pretty high. -----GAMEPLAY----- The gameplay is awesome. It is Pokemon (and its fast paced, unlike diamand and pearl were). You run around and explore areas, finding your way through puzzles and areas, and pitting your Pokemon together in classic RPG battles. Pokemon in its prime. -----CONCLUSION----- This game is awesome. If you do not own either black or white, buy one of them (or both!!!). These games are true Pokemon classics... enough said!",yes: I recommend this product,,8,1,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Plants vs. Zombies - Xbox 360,PopCap Games,It's More Than Just a Flash Game!,"Plants Vs. Zombies is a very intriguing game; I bet none of us would think that we'd be playing a Tower Defense for weeks on end.

The concept is very simple and it actually works better than you'd think. It's always fun to see what lawn setup works best and how you can create new and wild plant formations to clear away the zombies. Also, the grid-style map really does work well as a mouse substitute for the Xbox 360.

There are issues with this game too. You may hear everyone rave about how addicting the game is, but it really is easy to let go and forget to come back to. The gameplay really isn't something that will leave you wanting more and more. Some levels are very difficult and will force a lot of gamers off. After 20 attempts, you just lose interest and it's hard coming back to it.

Overall, with it's awesome price, and loads of extra content, this is definitely a game I would recommend.",yes: I recommend this product,,7,1,11 years ago,4.0,4.3364,110

This game is full of fun levels of great graphics and combat. This is something that reminds me of Castle Crashers. Anyway, if you see this game, BUY IT! This will be money well spent.

Plants vs. Zombies - Xbox 360,PopCap Games,10.. Really?... Yes Really....,"I was not much of a believer until I played the PC version. The Xbox360 version is way better of course. This is one of those games that you can play when you are tired of shooting it out in your favorite shooter or exhausted of playing your sports games. This game will actually help your brain relax and take a much needed break with something different. You can play this game in between your hardcore sesions. For the price, it is an excellent value. The graphics are crisp and simple. The sounds will also make you crack up laughin sometimes. It does have repetitive soundtracks, but they are not annoying. There is just this element of good 'ol fun about this game. Within the game there's not only the story mode, but Puzzle and Minigames also. There's no online capability, but it does allow for you to play with a friend on the same screen (co-op, vs., and story). The main story is not long, but then you can replay it with new challenges over and over. So in a way it is unlimited. It also has a ""Garden"" section where you can actually grow plants and sell them for money. Money that you can use to increase your arsenal of plants and unlock other features in the game. Very entertaining for all ages. And don't get me wrong, I am as hardcore gamer as it comes, but this is just a good fun and funny game. I gotta give credit when deserved.

The other is the graphics. I like that the pokemon move but its pixelated. The final reason is the triple battle.

They are obviously in it for the money now and have no compassion towards it. 3D imaging is just lame to me, I dont care about the graphics, I just care if i can see what im doing while having fun. Pesonally Ive been playing pokemon since FireRed, and Black and White versions are just not worth it to me.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,3,10,10 years ago,2.0,4.4195,553
Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,New and Upgraded Game Mechanics,"Pokémon Black is a great and refreshing addition to the series. Generation V adds in new pokémon (155 new ones to be exact, which is the greatest amount added to date) to excite and surprise both new and continuing fans. The updated graphics from Diamond/Pearl/Platinum are beyond what anyone who followed the game’s announcements at E3 expected (including me). Game Freak took the capabilities of Nintendo’s DS, a system that came out over five years ago, and pushed them to their absolute maximum. At first glance the graphics seem the same, but the battle animations as well as a few of the cities really pop out in stunning detail. Having said that, this review is mainly geared toward the continuing fans that understand the game’s underlying mechanics such as IVs, EVs, and the nature of breeding for competitive play.
After you beat the Elite Four, you can put two pokémon into the daycare (I’ve heard that you can only place one unless you do beat the E4). The breeding process is the same as in previous games. However, the Poké Gear doesn’t exist anymore making it much more difficult to know when an egg is ready. Also, it is worth mentioning that the path directly by the daycare is much shorter than in Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, making it more difficult to travel the thousands of steps needed.
The Unova region brings a variation to the traditional Battle Tower/Frontier with the new Battle Subway. Although differently titled, it still brings the Battle Points system back with the same kinds of competitive items such as the focus sash, choice band/scarf/specs, life orb, the power items, as well as a select few TMs. On a quick side note, TMs in the Black/White games do NOT go away after use. Once you have it, it stays for good, which is always a good thing for creating more than one pokémon with amore than adequate move set.
Training pokémon in EVs in the Black/White games is very easy. Using the power items on a pokémon while training them works exceptionally well. Some of the early cities have pokémon in the wild grass that are low level and can be grinded easily
Pokémon Black and White really help improve upon its previous game’s mechanics and breeding systems. The new and improved Battle Subway paving the way for easy access to battle items as well as TMs lasting forever really add to its appeal in the MLG aspect of Pokémon. All in all, Pokémon Black and White are excellent additions to the series, and I highly recommend that anyone with a DS pick this game up immediately!",yes: I recommend this product,,4,4,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,The flaws,"Look, nearly everyone is saying all the good things that this game has. Therefore, I'm going to point out the flaws. I love this game and am in no way trashing it, I'm just saying what I don't like about it since everything else has been taken. First off, they took away most if not all of the puzzles in the game. I can't remember one classic strength puzzle in the game, which would be impossible considering how big they made the bouldars. Second, there's no big end game dungeon. In fact, the only good dungeon in the game is only a plot device. Third, there's no big surf area like in Hoenn. Fourth, the gym leaders are way too easy. Only one gave me any trouble. And, lastly, there isn't enough use of the new battle system. Although, when double battles came out, there wasn't much use of them. I suppose we can expect a Pokemon Colosseum type game soon for multi-battles. Once again, I do like this game. I'm just pointing out the flaws so you know what you're getting into.",yes: I recommend this product,,8,0,10 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553

Only thing I dont like is that sometimes when I'm in the union room on wifi, It doesnt let me do anything at times.

You know how in the old pokemon games their was a pokemon with just a picture of that pokemon, and it would show the text of it does, and show like a little animation of how it attacked you.

Star Wars The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition - Xbox 360,LucasArts,It's showing Cracks but still worth playing,"Tons of cool extras and new unlockables etc. But the main games issues remain. The devs or rather the publisher EA has not done their due diligence in making a special edition. The controls remain somewhat unresponsive and the animations suffer with all the new costumes and some of the physics that they undergo.

Star Wars The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition - Xbox 360,LucasArts,Great Title,"The Force Unleashed is magnificent. The graphics on the first (TFU) are good, not as good as the second but, they are still very good. The Ultimate Sith Edition is a great Star Wars fan collectors item, steelcase, a card on a character, booklet, and most of all the DLC is included! This game has some time behind it, if you may have played the second on before this, you won't be disappointed to back track to play this title. As the graphics are good, controls are the same, story line is good, and you will put more time in this game in order to beat it than the second. If you want the full story of whats going on I Recommend playing this one before 2 or you maybe lost as to who is who and how you got where the second one picks up at. Some of the names in both games are in the movies. This game doesn't honestly connect any movies together, so don't expect that out of it. In all honesty the game is supposedly taking place between Star Wars 3 and 4, but it doesn't honestly bridge the two! Great game for kids and adults alike, and any Star Wars fan. You can use force powers, lightning, repulse, push, and many more to make your way through the stages and defeat the enemies. Custom customs are available to change your appearance, along with sabers, multiple colors to choose from, and different handles mean different boosts in points, health, damage, etc. I recommend this game to anyone who like action-adventures and/or Star wars in general.",yes: I recommend this product,,17,2,10 years ago,4.0,3.9615,26

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Beautiful Addition to Pokemon,"Although the pokemon in this generation may not seem as great as in the past, the settings around them fit them perfectly to make them seem a lot better. Adding onto the 3d cutscenes introduced in Heartgold/Soulsilver, Pokemon Black adds many new 3d settings such as more 3d cutscenes, 3d bridges and other setting in which you move around in 3d, and a beautiful boat ride around a city. The only bad thing about this game is the fact that there is an incredibly repetitive story line and not as much to do after the game unlike previous games (Hopefully Dream World will make up for that). The trading is a lot better with a not-so-tedious cutscene that only takes up a few seconds and infared trading is even faster! Fun little things to do over wi-fi/wireless add to the game play experience and affect your single-player world as well with black city which is suprisingly a nice addition to the game. Overall the game is quite fun but don't expect it to hold you for that long as the game is kind of short but every moment of it will take your breath away with its amazing graphics never before seen on the DS.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,0,10 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553

Star Wars The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition - Xbox 360,LucasArts,The FORCE is strong with this ONE!!,"Star Wars The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition, is a great game. I know that people complain about the length of the of the original game released last year as a major problem. This edition has three new levels including the exclusive non-downloadable Hoth level. So the three extra levels on the second disc gives this game more length and playablility. Not to mention that you also get extra downloadable content such as the costumes that you could buy online and some exclusive to this edition. This edition also comes in a nice steel case with an exclusive artbook and foreward from the creators of the game, and exclusive card of one ot the main characters of the game. Also, you get two disc the first is the main game and the second is the extra three levels this is a great deal for the cost of this game. This game has incredible graphics my jaw drop a few times, because the sights in the game and the details are incredible. The sound effects is also awesome not to mention the classic Star Wars score and the new opening theme is great. The only minor problem I have is that sometimes it can be hard to lock on a certain objects to force grip and throw it in a particular direction. But other than that, the play controls are spot on. I also like how they make you build up your force powers in the game that way you can pick which ones that you want to beef up in your order. And speaking of force powers, I really like how they are over the top in terms of power. This is a great game a must buy, pick it up.",yes: I recommend this product,,29,3,12 years ago,5.0,3.9615,26

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,"It's great, but not the best","Pokemon Black was a very great game, and I was impressed, but it lacked perfection. I liked that in Diamond and Pearl, the climax was before the eighth gym, and the pokemon league. This way you could train your legendary pokemon during the pokemon league. This would help a lot in this game espescially since Reshiram works good against the Elite four. If they made another pokemon game in the future, It might be better if they put the climax before the eighth gym. This game also felt shorter than others. I don't have Heartgold or Soulsilver, so I don't know how long the story is, but if you look at platinum, it's a lot harder than black. Black also seems easier, especially since you don't have to complete the Unova Pokedex to get the national pokedex.

WWE 2K19 - PlayStation 4,2K Games,WWE 2K19 Review,"The WWE 2K games have been games I have stopped getting into after 2K15. The reason mainly was that I personally didn’t like the whole trying to be as realistic to what you see live on TV. I loved games like WWF No Mercy, Smackdown Here Comes the Pain, WWE Day of Reckoning, ect. The reason I loved those games was because it was pretty easy to get into and it wouldn’t take long for people to get use to the controls. So when I finally got my copy of WWE 2K19 I was excited because I can play as wrestlers from the current WWE/NXT roster, but I was also worried that the controls would be something would keep me from enjoying the game. Thankfully I grew to really enjoy this game, even though there are some things keeping it from being great.



In past WWE games there were story modes that either were original stories made by the developers or the story mode would be a simulation of past wrestling moments like the Attitude Era. This time around the game's story mode revolves around current WWE Superstar Daniel Bryan. The story mode shows a lot of moments of his career like one of his first matches in WWE, when he went by the name Bryan Danielson. To his big main event matches with John Cena at Summerslam for the WWE Championship and the Triple Threat Match between him, Randy Orton, and Batista at Wrestlemania 30. I really got into this story mode mainly because I am a fan of Daniel Bryan, plus it was really cool to see all of his big matches replicated in video game form and a lot of the scripted moments during those matches were great. It felt like I was really rewatching the matches it was simulating. I really don't have an issue with the story format 2K is taking with these games but, the story mode was pretty short. I think it would have been better if there were 2 more wrestlers getting to same treatment. Someone that comes to mind is the coverboy himself AJ Styles could have gotten the same treatment.



As for the gameplay which was my biggest concern walking into this game, is pretty much a more technical game, but it still is pretty easy to get into if you have played some of the WWE Smackdown vs Raw games. The only added feature is the payback abilities which is something you can trigger during a match, that can either give you a finisher stock or if there is a moment you know it will be hard to break a pin or submission you can use the resiliency ability and you automatically kick out of a pin/submission. There are a lot of abilities in this game and each superstar has something that fits their character. The way you can use payback abilities is by filling up a bar which can only be filled if you are fighting. And when the time is right payback abilities can help save you in a lot of situations.



Other added features to this game include match types like 5 Man Match types, more match types for 6 Man matches, and now 8 Man matches. Looking at 8 Man matches specifically, it ran pretty well, I didn’t feel like the game was running slow because of all the wrestlers on the screen at the same time. There were a lot of times when the game would glitch during matches like the Elimination Chamber, where sometimes characters would stretch as if they were Mr. Fantastic or one of Bailey’s wacky waving inflatable tube man and while it was funny to see sometimes it did happen a couple of times and I hope things like that get patched.



Overall WWE 2K19 was a game I really enjoyed playing and I’m glad I don't need to rely on past wrestling games as my only way to play wrestling games. I wanted to play a really good wrestling game with wrestlers that I watch on TV or with the help of WWE Creation in 2K19, people can make wrestlers from other companies like New Japan, TNA, ROH, ect and later upload the characters they made online and people can download them so they can be added to their games. And a lot of the created wrestlers people have made are fantastic and could have easily have passed as playable from the get go. WWE 2K19 is a really good time and while there are some improvements that can be made to it like adding more stories to go through, it was great to play a solid wrestling game.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,1,3 years ago,4.0,4.2351,1195
WWE 2K19 - PlayStation 4,2K Games,Sperating Male and Females in Character selection,"Ok, so I haven't really dived into the game yet, but I did check out a few things it had to offer.  One of the things I do like is in the menu, they actually separated Male wrestlers from Female Wrestlers. The reason why I like this is because female wrestlers can not face guy Wrestlers, and sadly enough male wrestlers outnumber Female ones on the game 5 to 1 (if that...) So having to scroll through a super long list of Male wrestlers just to find the females to decide which ones I want to throw into the match was VERY annoying.  (Note: I do not know if this feature was in WWE 2k18 as I only played the Switch version for.. a small amount of time due to obvious reasons. But if it was, they I'm glad they kept it that way.  Otherwise I'm glad they added it.)",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,2,2,3 years ago,4.0,4.2351,1195

Dark Pictures: Man of Medan - PlayStation 4,Bandai,Very Boring- Not Scary At All- Don't Bother,This game doesn’t live up to Supermassive’s “Until Dawn”. This game is extremely boring and not scary at all. The few attempts it makes to scare you just aren’t scary. It all takes place mainly on an old WW2 ship. It could have been so much more scary. It doesn’t have nearly as good of a setting as Until Dawn. The game just doesn’t seem polished or maybe even finished. This game and “Little Hope” are both this boring and not scary.

The game had so many glitches and bugs.  My screen would freeze and I'd miss quick-time events.  The jumpscares were average.  There is no closure on the plot, you never find out what happened on the ship.  After all the action in the beginning of the game, you'd think they would give you an explanation as to what happened but there wasn't any closure whatsoever.  The game was completely rushed and after I finished I was honestly a little bit mad that I wasted money on this.  They couldn't have put less effort into a game.  I would not recommend this game.

Visually, the game is great. The mood is proper, as is the plot. I recommend adjusting the 'reaction time' and quick-time event settings, because not all of us have razor-sharp reflexes. 

Overall, it feels like a 'choose your own adventure' style, and is fun if the settings are made proper for your playstyle.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,0,0,1 year ago,3.0,4.1324,476

It has jump scares, a decent storyline and the narrator just adds to the overall ambiance that you are playing in a horror game. It is not action-packed per say, but very strategic. You have to think and make hard decisions without a lot of time to do so, which can be super stressful and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Dark Pictures: Man of Medan - PlayStation 4,Bandai,"Adventurous, but a bit awkward","At first the controls and the general gameplay seems a bit awkward, but it makes sense after you get further into the game. The general plot is interesting, kind of like a modern twist-a-plot book from the 80`s. That's honestly the best part of this game is the element of changing now comes, although there's the usual plot line limitations. The character relationships are immature for my taste, being in my forties. But, for the younger generation, I guess it's normal for them. I think with a smoother flowing, more plausible plot, this game series would be excellent.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,BEST Pokémon game yet!,"The game has pulled all the stops on the graphics. The city is so large, that the 3-D effects makes you get lost in the city, and when you try to catch a Pokémon, the Poké Ball is actually in 3-D too, so you see the Ball shake at an aerial view. The game changes season every month, so you'll be exploring the whole region for secret areas that normally you couldn't access in a certain season. Also, as the seasons change, certain Pokémon are more common in certain seasons than others. And now you don't need to go to a Pokémon Center to play Multiplayer, thanks to infrared technology, you just point the games at each other and you can have a battle right away. And, the new ways to battle like triple and rotation battles, you need to think what you're opponent will do before you make a move. And there are many new things in the game too, but I am not going to say any more spoilers, so, get yourself the game and enjoy what the new game has to offer. Ether Black or White, the stories are the same, except one area in the region is different in one version than the other.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,"Good, but Definitely Not Great","Story: Right from the start, the big cinematic/anime intro is based on a character that isn't you. Yep, and the story is pretty slow at the beginning. Team Plasma is closely related to the Pokemon version of PETA: only they still use Pokemon to battle with. One thing that is new is that your rivals are actually involved throughout the game and not just in certain parts. Overall, okay, but not great. Gameplay: Pretty much another Pokemon game, w/o new Pokeballs. You've got 150+ brand new Pokemon and that's it so a big throwback to the Kanto region. I did find some of the new attacks and abilities interesting, but that's a given with any new generation. The XP system is different, too: instead of fixed amounts, Pokemon level up depending on the level gap between other Pokemon. This makes it a bit more challenging and is one of its strongest points. Miss the touch interface emphasis from HG/SS, but it's still present. The C-Gear is cool and other goodies make it stand out from the previous versions. Graphics: Many Pokemon are not very appealing or original, and the few that are can be a lot of fun to use. There is a lot more 3D influence in this game and the various camera angles and field designs are really impressive. This is another one of the game's strongest points. I wish they didn't trade so much clarity of the Pokemon designs for movement; they looked really good in HG/SS. Sound: It's an okay score, not bad or great. Some tunes are catchy, but overall okay. Interesting how certain elements in the game cause changes to the soundtrack. Lasting Appeal: Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the game, but not blown away. Definitely a must for Pokemon fans, but a little sketchy for little kids. Though the battle system is relatively the same, leveling up isn't. I doubt that they will get through the game easily with just a Lv. 70 Emboar.",yes: I recommend this product,,2,1,10 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553

Dark Pictures: Man of Medan - PlayStation 4,Bandai,mehh,"Im going to start off by saying that I am a big fan of these types of games ever since heavy rain. I love story driven games and the ones that have mostly quick time events usually have this element. However, I was kinda let down by this one. I really enjoyed until dawn so I was excited but this didn't have everything I wanted. For the most part I felt extremely board with the story. I honestly was not very interested. It seemed like a very safe go around and thats what the game was. So if your a fan of this game type you will probably like it but dont go in hoping for too much. Some of the redeeming qualities were the introduction of being able to play with friends and how you would get to choose your characters.

If you're more of a trainer than a collector, I'd recommend Black, because it has Black City.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,good but not as good as soulsilver and heartgoldds,not going to lie to you its a good game but soulsilver and heartgold are still the 2 best pokemon games on the ds which is a remake. got new pokemon new storyline. the game play is good. graphics are good. the new pokemon are better looking than diamond pearl and platinum pokemon. the storyline will have you drawn in wanting you to keep playing to see what comes next into the game. the down fall is no verse seeker which makes it harder to raise up your pokemon. the other con is can't trade between older ds pokemon games and black/white. so you'll have to transfer them all over again like in platinum diamond an dpearl which they had a reason to do that but black and white doesn't. the transfer needs to ds systems and when you transfer you'll have to shoot pokeballs at the pokemon and its timed. time runs out the pokemon go back to their respective games. i don't like the transfer in this game. graphics are nice they'll be the 1st thing you'll take notice to from the way the towns look to pokemon battles. sound could have been a bit better same sounds as the other ds games. controls are simple you'll get used to them fast.lasting appeal will as soon as you beaten the game oyu'll want your other pokemon from your older ds pokemon games. get it but don't expect it be as good as soulsilver or heartgold though. 9 out of 10. well worth your buy.,yes: I recommend this product,,1,3,10 years ago,4.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,An Absolute Masterpiece,"We first found out about Pokemon Black and White over a year ago. Then it came out in Japan in September, and now it's finally in Amercia. It was well worth the wait. Pokemon Black is the greatest game in the Pokemon franchise by a considerable margin. What seperates it from the other pokemon games is that it is just different. All the pokemon in the main story are brand new! There are two new types of battles. They are rotation battles and triple battles. They are a fresh new take on a classic battle system. This is one of those games that you just can't put down. I played 20 Hrs. the first four days I had this game! It's just that good! It is a VERY fresh take on a classic games series. It has absolutely AMAZING graphics! These are by far the best graphics ever seen in a pokemon game. These graphics push the DS graphic capabilites to its limits. This is a very beautiful game. Over and over again, I stopped playing to stare at the graphics. You can't understand how good the graphics are until you've played the game. The game has AWESOME music! I've played a lot of games and I can't think of a game with as good music as this game. The music is one of the many reasons that this is the best pokemon game yet. This is a long game as it will take you about 24 hrs. to beat it and then their is the aftergame. This is the longest pokemon aftergame yet. There's even a brand new champion to face! There are a lot of legendary pokemon to catch. This is will last a VERY long time! The aftergame is just massive. The game has the best story of any game I have played in a long time. There is A LOT of character development and moral questions. The game takes pokekmon to new levels. You ask yourself ""Is Team Plasma (the villians) really evil? There motives seem pure and good."" The game has outstanding pokemon and many new ways to play. This is my new favorite game of all time. I would reccomend it to ANYONE who considers themself a gamer. This game is a system buyer. I would buy a DS just for this game. This game is an absolute masterpiece and should not be missed by anyone.",yes: I recommend this product,,15,1,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,A Whole New Experience,"I got White for the Legendary guy and I gotta say, this is a whole new experience in the world of Pokemon. They upped the difficulty so that you can't simply breeze through the game with a single strong guy, which surprised me; but hey, who doesnt enjoy a bit of a challenge? The experiments with 3-D are very interesting and fun but unnecessary; this is certainly just the start of something big. I feel as though these little 3-D areas will become the center-piece of future games. And I LOVE that the characters frolick and close their eyes! Seriously genius innovations. My complaints are the constant involvement of rivals and the 5th generation of Pokemon. They really should've stopped a couple years ago, but we keep coming back... :P While certainly not the BEST of the Pokemon games (Hi-ho, SoulSilver!!!), Black and White provide an entertaining and unique experience that should be enjoyed by both new players and die-hard classics alike.",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Best Pokemon Game To Date!!!,"When I first heard they were producing another Pokemon game, I will admit I was more than a bit....... unsure. At first glance of the new Pokemon, I actually laughed, and said this was going to be the worst game, and they should really give up on Pokemon if this is what they've got. I WAS WRONG. While some of the Pokemon are still unsatisfying compared to past Pokemon, I have truly fallen in love with this game. The graphics are impeccable, and Castelia City is the most incredible work of art and amazing graphics I've ever seen on a Nintendo DS. The only complaint I have is that the menu should be on the touch screen like it was in Heart Gold and Soul Silver, instead of the C Gear..... but I love the C gear as well so it's hard to decide how I really feel about the set up. Although, like I said, I'm sill iffy on the Pokemon, but I understand how they came to be so, since the game is largely focused on industry, the Pokemon reflect that. Trubbish and Garbodor are the only two I still really don't like. But again, Best Pokemon game to date. I'm truly in love!",yes: I recommend this product,,0,0,10 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Expectations Reached,"I received Pokemon Black on March 6th, 2011. Since then, I've been playing for quite some time. The Pokemon are certainly different from other versions of Pokemon such as diamond, ruby, silver, etc. Generation X and V Pokemon show how far the Pokemon company has come since Generation I (yellow, red, blue). The graphics show how advanced the Pokemon Company has become. The 3D really shows and if the Pokemon Company is planning on making a version for the upcoming 3DS, I would certainly think that it would truly be a breath-taking game. As a player, I certainly love this game. I do believe that team Plasma's goal is quite different from those of the past and there are many mysteries awaiting to be uncovered. If you are a dedicated player who plans on sticking through Pokemon Black and/or White until the end, I strongly suggest purchasing this game. However, if you feel that you will play it for a few days then quit, I would not recommend getting it because Pokemon Black & White are the kind of games you just have to stay until the end to fully understand everything.

That said it’s somewhat more intense than Until Dawn but not quite as intense as the VR Prequel to Until Dawn “The Inpatient” but it’s still just as unsettling as the both games.

Also some trainers give you free items for you beating them. But type match-ups can be a struggle. So hear is something very useful. At the first gym, the leader will tell you you should have a pokemon that is good againt bad match-ups so he tells you to go train at a sertain place. Go there and find this one guy who gives you a free pokemon for an advantage at the gym.

They seemed rushed and unoriginal. *SPOILER WARNING* Second, once you beat the Elite Four, you would expect to fight the champion, right? Wrong. The evil team's leader, N, comes and makes you fight him, right after catching Reshiram. Then you fight the other ""leader"". I was looking forward to fighting Adeku. Not the two leaders.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Change is always bad,It nice to see game freak mixing up there games a little. Instead of just simply slappin down the same content with more pokemon they try to push themselves. They are making pokemon move in battle and you can see most of your character. Obviously there are people who are not big fans of change but to be honest I feel this is a step in the right direction on there part. Also most might complain about the gameplay do to the fact of the short story and not much depth but to be truthful I never played it for that reason.

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,BEST IN YEARS!,"I have played the JP version of Pokemon Black (and White ^^) and I have to say that these games are just the type of kick to the series to really bring Pokemon back to light.

In a move that hasn't happened since the time of R/B/Y, Pokemon Black/White introduces not only new pokemon but 155 NEW pokemon, NONE of them are a pre-evolution or an evolved form of previous pokemon, new, never-before used pokemon types are used, brand new abilities, and the Team of this generation has a unique motive!

Also, in the new region of Isshu (Unova in the English version apparently), none of the first 493 pokemon appears in regular gameplay before beating the game. This might sound bad at first but wait until you see how the developers make them available for capture (at least in the JP version anyway)!

The aesthetic changes are very refreshing. The 3D graphics in this game are amazing (for a DS game). The biggest examples of these graphics are...no....I already said too many spoilers. ;) However, my only qualm with this game is the fire starter. You'll see why when you evolve him. Also, there aren't very good HM hoarders this time around but these factors don't actually affect the game that much, if at all.

Unless a certain game is released next year, Pokemon B/W could very well be the best game of 2011 and of the first quarter of 2012. Anyone who considers him even a little bit of a gamer MUST play this game at least once.

I end my review with the battle system. With the addition of Rotation Battles and Triple Battles, more animated battle sprites, and with combo attacks in addition to everything else, playing Pokemon B/W made me feel like I was 4 again playing Pokemon Blue for the first time.",yes: I recommend this product,,13,1,11 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

Player control is a bit clunky, and not being able to pan the camera angle is kinda frustrating,  but I really dug the dynamics of trait and relationships as you make decisions,  as well as the Bearings (how decisions you make affect future story options and play) . 
It was kinda short, but I guess that's to be expected,  so the developpers can bang out several in the series (hopefully quickly) , and the price reflects that (~30, compared with the usual 60). I managed to keep all 5 characters alive (which was MUCH harder to do in Until Dawn) , so I'm not sure if that's simply because this one is less lethal overall,  or if I just got lucky.",yes: I recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,0,0,2 years ago,4.0,4.1324,476

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,A Must-Buy For 2011 / I Own This Game,"When Pokemon Black and White were first announced near the beginning of 2010, I knew I had to get my hands on a copy. Surely enough, following it's release in Japan, I held a copy of it in my own hands just a few days later. Now, 412 hours into the game (At least, says my DS) I can safely assure you that this game is nothing short of fantastic. GameFreak has outdone themselves with this new duo, improving upon the classical formula that we all came to love over a decade ago. The new 3-D layout of the graphics is nice and very aesthetically pleasing at moments. While many would be surprised, the continued use of the 2-D sprites actually fits quite well in the new over-world. Battles are more fluid. In-Battle, Pokemon now have fluid animation continuously throughout the battle, comparable to the beginning animation you used to see for a brief second or two when sending out a Pokemon in the previous games. The camera moves around slightly, keeping your attention to the battle, wondering what view it may pan to next. The difficulty is not too hard, some may find that the final challenge in the story is rather easy, but that's not a big concern, for there is a long after-game segment. In fact, there are even multiple cities that are unavailable until the story has been completed! The number of Pokemon continues to increase, as this generation adds a whopping 156 new ones, the most ever to be added in a single Generation, surpassing even the originals! The audio is clear, the Pokemon cries are now extremely unique and interesting, and the music tracks are outstanding. While I can't be certain, there are likely more music tracks in this game than any previous one of the series! Having shown my friends this game on my DS, I've yet to find a single one that has not been intrigued, or interested in this game. With new moves, new Pokemon, and a fresh new outlook on the game, Pokemon Black is a must-buy next year.",yes: I recommend this product,,9,1,11 years ago,5.0,4.4195,553

It only took like 2.5hrs to complete.  Also, if you choose to play online with a friend be prepared for important scenes of dialogue to end abruptly. I won’t explain why/how I think that happens because it may give away the plot but I’m hoping that by the time “Little Hope” is released the developers have fixed that glitch.

Dark Pictures: Man of Medan - PlayStation 4,Bandai,Below Average but overall OK,"In order of my game values. 

Narrative: was expecting more, overall it’s ok for 4 hours. Just massive horror tropes, nothing special. Character depth: very weak. Storytelling: average. 

Gameplay: Playables move like tanks, qte are decent but repetitive and nothing new, would have never did a second play though from the beginning, incredibly slow and not entertaining. Chapter selection available after first. 

Graphics: for a major def far from what you would expect from a 2019 big budget game. Frame rate drops, bugs, bad acting. 

Really hope the second title will learn from this flop. Until Dawn seems far more advanced. If it doesn’t get better I doubt will get the third title.

I did not play Movie or coop. MN seems fun with friends, coop sounds interesting. 

Overall: I don’t regret my time spent on it and made all 5 survive with 1 playthrough + 2 chapter selects at the very end. Not worth full price, ok to buy used and have some nice jumps but very far from titles side as Detroit, Heavy Rain le Until Dawn (which still needs work but was fine for the year and moment it came out) - just to stay in the same ballpark.",No: I don’t recommend this product,Verified Purchaser,0,0,2 years ago,2.0,4.1324,476

Pokemon Black - Nintendo DS,Nintendo,Pokemon Black and White,"These Pokemon games look really sweet. If you like the Pokemon franchise then you should get it. These games are really different from the previous ones yet they are the same. These games are those games that never get old. The new pokemon look awesome, and new features that have never been seen in previous games. Also if you choose Pokemon White you don't get to see Black City, you get to see the White Forest and if you choose Pokemon Black you don't get to see White Forest, but you get to see Black City. So you got to choose which one you want to see White Forest or Black City.

Fire and Water were always chosen. Im NOT a fan of the water pokemon in this game though so my choices will be Grass and Fire...Another thing the pokemon company needs to change is the type of fire starter pokemon we get. This is the 3rd time in a row we've gotten a fire/fighter (torchic,combusken,blaziken/chimchar,monferno,infernape/pokaboo, chaoboo, and enbuoh) starter pokemon.

Borderlands 2,2K Games,Too depressing,"Borderlands 1 trumps this game in almost every important aspect.
The guns in B1 look much better. In B2 they all look really weird that you would think they're all alien guns.
In B1 you like the bad guys(especially General Knoxx), in B2 you are annoyed by them as they tell unfunny jokes and crude humor.
There are also some mean things that they do to old characters in B2 that I really hate. I can not tell to you here, you must google it.
The atmosphere is drenched with depression every step of the way, that it sucks.
Also they limited you to 27 items backpack. Yes, a huge downgrade from B1.
Gearbox made some lame excuses about why it is that way, but you can tell the writer does not even believe what the he was writing.
It's such a disappointment, much more so because of so much work put into it(good environs, mini bosses), ruined at the core by flawed ideas.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,1,12,8 years ago,3.0,4.1875,16

Borderlands 2,2K Games,Uber Awesome Game,"Hey guys, just wanted to shed some light on pc version and console version as I own both. If you have a pc that can run it then get it for pc you'll love all the added Physx stuff that goes along with it and having native 1080p support where as the console has 720p then upconverted and no AA applied. The game for all 3 systems is solid and very fun. More story this time around. Graphics are good but if your a PC gamer and play this game on console for example I originally purchased for Xbox and edges of the game are really jagged and some of the graphics are meh. On PC you can apply AA or FXAA and it'll get rid of the jagged edges and the graphics are bumped up. Also the game supports physx so you got some extra goodies with the game if your card support it.

Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,A Series to Triumph,"Mass Effect 3 was one of the best games I've played in a while, recently I bought the trilogy for my PC beforehand having been played on my console. I believe that the best aspect of this game including it's trilogy is it's story. The Mass Effect series does a profound job at taking hold of your emotions, you're going to get attached to these characters, meaning you'll feel triumphant when they fight by your side, you'll be amused when they socialize with you and most of all you'll be sad when they die. Although, you're going to have more of an emotional connection with your character, Shepard. He/She is the embodiment of yourself, whether you abide by what's right or what's wrong. Sure a lot of people create their character to be the hero or villain they can never strive to be but if you're like me then you'll be emotionally connected in defining Shepard, in such ways as picking options that coincide with what you feel or even what you'd do in a similar situation. Anyway the voice acting is on par characters like Liara and Garrus portray a believable entity while Jennifer Hale as Femshep is astounding. In terms of the graphics you'll shutter in fear at the detail and height of the towering Reaper flagships and depending on your modeling skills, admire the beauty/handsomeness of your Shepard including other vital characters. Gameplay is great as usual, with a wide assortment of weapons to combat the reaper and cerberus hordes as well as the various abilities that further defy your foes. Lastly as for the ending, many say that it was awful but with the extended cut it's at least acceptable by RPG standards, what matters though is the journey not the destination in Mass Effect.",yes: I recommend this product,,14,0,7 years ago,4.0,3.6667,18

Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,Decent Action-Adventure,"This is easily Bioware's most casual-friendly, streamlined game. The RPG elements are very minimal and the high-octane action is pretty much driving the whole story. If you enjoy action-adventure games that simply tour different exotic set-pieces, then this game is well worth $30-$40. If you like quasi-strategic action shooters, you might have a great time with this. But as an RPG, and as the critical installment in a series, the game falls quite flat.

There were also quite a few graphical and sound glitches at launch, as well as gameplay hiccups that hurt the multiplayer experience. Beyond that, the ""action button"" technique that Bioware insists on using is quite cumbersome in this game. The action button has about 5 or 6 different functions, which leads to a lot of gameplay problems.

But people are very sore about the end of the game...will try not to spoil anything...this game had a very amazing ending. I wanted to shed a tear it was so amazing, and it came to a conclusion that has a cinematic ending that anyone would hope for if they were watching a film, its just that because it is a well loved game nobody likes it. The multiplayer sucks however, I am not going to lie about that, and you have to play it to get a decent ending out of the game.

Everything that made the first two games amazing is lacking. The plot has more holes that a metal seive. Most character development is poor, and many well-loved characters are simply not there.

The ending made no logical sense, and the decisions you made in this game meant very little in the end. I liked the previous two Mass Effect games much better.

Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,Awesome game!,"This game is amazing and if your a true Mass Effect fan and know how the games play, you know that there is much more to the game than just running thru the game and beating it! Mass Effect is one of the best gaming franchises ever made and yes, the ending was a bit of a disappointment, but if your a true die hard ME fan than this game is amazing and the ending shouldn't ruin the entire game for you. I went through and did all the side missions and played the multiplayer and got my effective military strength and galatic readyness as high as they could go and the ending was not as horrible as everyone is saying. If you go through and play it like a true ME fan you will love this game and when Bioware releases the new ending sometime this summer it will make the game even better.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,4,9 years ago,4.0,3.6667,18
Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,Bioware has become EA,"First off, I have a question: why is the spacebar used for so many tasks?! This alone has led to countless deaths (not even on the hardest difficulty) and should never have been allowed to happen. If you're picky about your controls and being able to customize them, don't get this game! Another complaint I have about customization, which is two-fold: why are the options under EXTRAS of all places?! And graphics settings don't even exist! If my computer is running anything in the background, I cannot play this game because I can't turn down the graphics settings from gorgeous to performance. Oh wait, I can turn dynamic shadows and anti-aliasing on and off, because that makes all the difference. No, wait, it doesn't. Finally, my third problem with this game: If you're a hardcore Mass Effect fan as I was, DO NOT buy this game! If you don't get the From Ashes DLC, it will not feel like a finished game! Then again, even with that, don't get it for the story, as the ending (trying to avoid spoilers) is the worst ending to a game I have seen in an EA title, much less a Bioware title. I've played Call of Duty games with better endings, and I don't even like those games! Ranting aside, the gameplay itself is epic, and it is DEFINITELY a fun game, especially the multiplayer. If you're in it for the gameplay, this game is definitely worth buying (other than the spacebar). It has the feel of an EA game rather than a Bioware game, however, so I'm conflicted on whether or not to recommend this game.",yes: I recommend this product,,4,4,9 years ago,4.0,3.6667,18
Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,Under-toned finish to a fantastic series,"The final installment of mass effect was fantastic all the through until the end. The final battle felt a little under-rated considering this was the build up for the series in the past five years. There have been a lot of complaints about small details at the ending but i won't say any in the event i spoil it for someone. My only complaint about the ending is how sloppily it felt (in mass effect standards, which is fairly high.) This game is well worth the money even still though, and is a fantastic experience you can't miss out on.",yes: I recommend this product,,1,1,9 years ago,4.0,3.6667,18
Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,"It's not about the destination, it's the journey.","This game ends a great trilogy and is a great investment of money. If you played any of the previous games, this game will be twice as good. But it is not unapproachable if you haven't. Some people complain about the ending, but there are 3 reasons this shouldn't discourage you from buying: 1) Developers have already agreed to write a new ending and are probably going to patch the game with it in the future, 2) The whole game is great enough (especially the whole series) to make the 'bad ending"" only a minor deterrence in a great game, and 3) story doesn't affect it's multiplayer, which is enjoyable as well. If you are looking into a new series to play, start with the first Mass Effect and play through to this one. It is a very worthwhile experience. Developers update the game and listen to feedback! And DLC is available!",yes: I recommend this product,,2,3,9 years ago,4.0,3.6667,18

Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,Good besides Ending,"Game was overall amazing like all the Mass Effect's. The multiplayer gets really boring and is repetitive. The ending is horrible for singleplayer.

Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,Lazy Ending Destroys Franchise,"The game engine is beautiful. The multiplayer co-op is fun and challenging. The story itself throughout is fun and enjoyable, plus they do an amazing job of tying the events of the previous two games together and making you feel like your choices matter.

In the end, though, they don't. The ending is so sloppily and lazily done it destroyed the whole franchise. Choices no longer matter as Deus Ex Machina tears apart the 'choose your own adventure' style of storyline for a force railroad that leaves the joy of playing these games bloody and broken on the tracks.

I can't even bring myself to try to play and enjoy the MP aspects of it anymore, there's just no point. I know the ending. I know my choices don't matter and in a fit of intellectual laziness, the devs have sauntered off to collect my money.

I give this 4 stars because there are some redeeming parts of the game. I won't give it any more because it has destroyed its own replay value through the terrible conclusion.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,14,9,9 years ago,2.0,3.6667,18
Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,Worth every penny.,"I hate to say it but this is the game SWTOR should have been. Graphics are very sharp and crisp at 1920*1080,story is incredible, and gameplay is simply alot of fun. Id rather play games of this quality several times through than pay monthly for any MMO. Dont miss out on this potential game of the year!",yes: I recommend this product,,1,4,9 years ago,5.0,3.6667,18
Mass Effect 3,Electronic Arts,Great until the end; terrible for trilogy wrapup,"Graphics and sound were great. I gave gameplay an average because as a squad shooter, it's just that. Controls are tight but even when set to use abilities, squad members frequently won't. I had to manually activate Ashley's marksman ability most of the time. Also, while you can order your squadmates to move somewhere, they won't always stay. Which results in them getting killed by heavy fire because they left the good position you had them in.

The game's storyline was good, but the ending was atrocious. It is wrapping up a trilogy of games. I expected two things. First, that it would show me glimpses of the main characters' lives in the aftermath. Secondly, that it would have a happy ending (yes, I got the ""good"" one). The ending was fifteen seconds of footage showing Joker and two other seemingly random characters. It was, in short (pun intended), awful.

I had to rate ""Lasting Appeal"" low for that reason. I can't imagine replaying the game to see that ending. Also, there is about 10 minutes of dialogue at the end that cannot be skipped. After how wonderful the journey was, I cannot fully express my disappointment in how poorly executed its end turned out to be.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,6,4,9 years ago,4.0,3.6667,18

LEGO Batman: The Videogame - PlayStation 3,Warner Bros.

I completely beat this game and found all of the minikits, red bricks, etc. It is a very fun game and easy for younger gamers to play and also enjoy. There are a lot of characters to play as; many of them are from the comic books. I have played and completed the Lego Star Wars One and Two and thoroughly enjoyed those. So basically take Lego Star Wars and place Batman in instead. Batman and Robin each have unique suits that help to acquire minkits and red bricks.

I've loved Batman my whole life and nothing is more satisfying as a gamer/fan than picking this up and finding that it actually did him justice. It was fun playing as Batman and Robin, and then getting to see the villain's perspective. The gameplay was fun and simple but the game did have its challenges, you actually had to think about your next move in order to solve problems correctly. I think the grunts are the most amazings sounds ever, I love how they don't talk! I played Batman Arkham Asylum before this (even though this game is older) and found some similarities that I though were pretty cool.The best part about it was 2 player, me and my little brother got to enjoy this together and it was so exciting.

And when that time came knew it would be even better than it than previous fellow lego games. I was right. Batman is my favorite DC superhero and for that to be mixed with one of my favorite toys was even better. This Game has them all, the famous arch enemies of the caped crusader including the joker, clayface, killer croc, and poison ivy. Plus like any other lego game you have an in game lobby were u can do various things such as play missions and collect studs. In batman u get to explore the bat cave and arkham asylum. like in lego star wars 2 u can make a custom character however you want which is still pretty fun to do.Also there are villian missions that show the other side of all the hero missions where you see how the villians concoct there master plan.

It was amazing how there is so many characters and missions. Plus all their powers they have and the suits, and the mini clips. My favorite funny clip for now is probably the part where Cat woman kissed Batman and then Robin took his tongue out and looked like he was grossed out! Also on the villains side my favorite power from joker is the electric buzzer, because every time you shock someone it's like they're getting a x-ray but getting shocked out the same time. I can't wait to finish the whole game, then I probably would want a LEGO Batman 2 then,3 and then continuing until they can't make any more but it kinda would help by taking most of the films they make like the cartoon, reality, and LEGO films they show and make take it and put it in the game!

The story mode makes sense and the Free Play is the best. The attention to details is perfect for a game like this. Is not an easy game to play but it is not hard. it takes a little of understanding what can and can't be done. The game itself is pretty long due to the fact there's so much items to find.

I was disappointed with Lego Indiana Jones, which left much to be desired. However as I hoped Batman has been awesome. Before Batman, Lego has based their game-play solely off movie storyline and action. Batman has it’s own unique storyline, and short clips between chapters in the game which are awesome and funny. The unique story allows for new Bat-Suits, new gear, new ablities, and new things are not just for Batman but also for Robin. Also your main page is in the Bat Cave, or as villains in Arkham. You also get access to all the Bat-Gear, Bat-boat, Bat-Wing, Bat-mobile. Oh yeah, players also get to play as the villains in their own games separate from those of Batman! Of course all the great villains have an appearance, and as true to the Lego form there are the mini-games.

You can choose to jump in the batmobile, the Batwing, or the Batboat and take off to a mission, or just explore the batcave and find a bunch of goodies not to mention you can also go upstair to Wayne Manor for more fun. The game play is entertaing to the fullest extent of a Lego game. Plus as you progress through the game, youll find different suits that reallyd to help you out through parts of the level. The new Bat-o-rang system makes it easir to take out thugs in a adam west fashion & the vechile levels are to die for.

Sure, there are voluptuous ninjas that lose clothing when they are defeated (my wife flipped out at this LOL), but the game is surprisingly deep. There is a lot of strategy involved when it comes to attacking, weapons, reloading and timing, as well as the fast paced nature of the game. Single player campaigns will help you unlock more ability cards, weapons and assist pets, but the real fun is online. My only gripe is that like many games from Japan, there is WAY TOO MUCH DLC that one has to buy to access more perks and costumes, as well as additional characters. All in all, it is a fun game.

"Senran Kagura Peach Beach Splash - No Shirt, No Shoes, All Service Edition",XSEED Games,Fight the SJW takeove!r Buy fanservice!,"Okay, political ramblings aside, this is nearly the ultimate in fanservice. Japanese anime schoolgirls in swimmy suits shooting water guns at each other 3rd person areba shooter style. Splatoon 2 with bewbs. This is where most people would say, ""I normally don't buy these types of games but I had to for the artistic merits and incredible story."" Not me. I like anything controversial and everything that goes against what the powers that be say is wrong, inappropriate, or politically incorrect. (I am also a fan of pretty anime schoolgirls and I do not apologize for that!)  I should probably mention this right now,  I hate Sony and I hate PlayStation for reasons I will not go into here. Let's just say fool me once shame on me, fool me 126 times, it must be Sony. I gave up fighting Sony and we finally bought a PS4 this year. I still hate Sony but I was missing out on too many games by fighting against them.  So I went over to the dark side, and it wasn't so bad after all. While Xbox still has it's amazing perks and features not found on PS4, I have found that Sony does some things Xbox has failed to do. What they do is JRPGS, fan service games, side scrolling shooters, and most importantly physical releases of games and true exclusives without the ""Play Anywhere"" pandering to the PC Master Race that Xbox does. Several of my favorite B-movie style games are PS4 exclusives, Onechanbara, Earth Defence Force, etc.which were formally Xbox 360 exclusive titles. The likes of Hatsune Miku and the Tales of... Series, among many others, are only found on PS4. Then there's Senran Kagura, and many others, in oversized collectors edition boxes. I loves me some collectors editions! Xbox has none anymore. While both companies are trying to force everyone to buy digital only games, it's great that PS4 hasn't yet crossed the line and Eliminated collectors editions.  I know this was supposed to be a review of Peach Beach Splash, but the game really speaks for itself. A fairly good tps with loads of fan service and a funny script.  The real point of this review is to state that it's time to urge others to buy both consoles this generation, just as we have in the past generations. Xbox has an amazing Backwards Compatibility library and some truly great games, Sony has the Japanese games library and some huge exclusives. Then there's Switch.... All I can say is there's potential there, and some day it will be worth buying. It's time to stop being fanboys and love both systems...

FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,"Elements for all fans, is something different","Overall, I liked this game. I played this after the FFXIII series, FFXV, and FF7 remake. The graphics are in the realm of FFXIII. Definitely, not as good as FFXV or 7 remake, but an older game, so that makes sense. There are elements of other older FF games - for those long time fans. I like being able to explore the overworld. Reminds me of the 1st and 6th games. The military campaign missions are fun. They remind me of the game of Risk. Leveling up is a bit of a chore, but XP grinds just go that way. Secret training missions are a quick way though, but that feels like cheating. The story is good, and detailed. It takes a second play through to pick up some of the nuances. I find the amount of characters a bit overwhelming, but I think it was done that way to make multiple play throughs fresh. Otherwise, it would get old quick. Trophies are realistic for those who care, but be prepared to work for some. I was a bit bummed about the music, some of it is okay, but I don't think I will like this soundtrack. The other FF games have always had the best music. Good for study and work type stuff. This one, ehh, not so much. In summary, fun, different, but not at the level of FFXV or remake 7.

When i started playing i realized how fun it was. So glad i picked this game up. People who dislike it are either not fans of final fantasy or have not truly played this game enough. This game is literally one of the darkest stories in FF history as well as a nice change in the mature feel.

FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,Why did we fight to port this?,"After a play through, I just don't get it. I may have enjoyed this game as a hand held RPG back when it came out. As a full price PS4 game? It is as weak a title as you're going to find on this system. THE GOOD: Combat is relatively fun for a while if you can stomach the camera. THE BAD: About everything else. Poor graphics, cringeworthy voice acting (seriously the worst I can recall seeing in a major title), convoluted, fragmented storyline, uninspired environments, and missions that seem to mean absolutely nothing. The multiple character thing also really detracts from the weight of what little story there is, and it's very hard to care.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,17,24,6 years ago,2.0,4.0427,117
FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,Gets boring fast,"An extremely frustrating game that becomes very monotonous between just simply completing tasks and using your free time before the next mission.

The game is very one-dimensional in it's combat design and I have just gotten tired of playing it. I thought it would be great as we have been anticipating a release of the game into the Americas for a while, but it's just so simple and easy.

On top of that, the game sports a glaring design flaw in which players are punished for preferring purely melee characters with limited ranged attack ability. It's becoming a recurring theme in the game industry to neglect melee oriented players when it comes to design and it absolutely needs to stop.

Yes it can be respected that melee characters shouldn't be ranged, but even our greatest real life athletes can perform dazzling aerial feats at inhuman speed every once in a while.

It's really frustrating when I encounter something I cannot fight because it is exclusively ranged and will not come down and fight me because it is like I am screwed from the second I decided which character I wanted to play most just because it's ranged attack capability is so limited.

I mean your AI allies are practically braindead anyway. Why does this game even have a party system? They just get in the way/waste resources.

I didn't expect a lot being that it was a PSP port but it's been a pretty disappointing experience. But Birth by Sleep and God Eater were pretty similar games and were done a lot better. Surprisingly good even for PSP games and I say that not to knock all PSP games but because of the genre of the game and limitations that a PSP will have compared to a console system with more buttons and superior control.

I have no outstanding opinion on the sound of the game, good or bad. Graphically, the camera's motion blur was very annoying but otherwise solid. Pretty game, but pretty boring gameplay unfortunately.

This game may be more suited to more casual gamers who are not as bothered by lack of polish on a game, but by the time I was at Chapter 7 I just didn't care what was going on in the story because I was bored out of my mind even playing the game.

I could go tons and tons more into detail with my disappointments but I don't really think it's fair to keep bagging on the game for reasons I have already stated (age, porting a game developed for a handheld).",No: I don’t recommend this product,,5,2,6 years ago,2.0,4.0427,117
FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,"Storyline is there, but the gameplay isn't.","I want to say first that after playing the game for 10-15 hours, I plan on returning the game for store credit. It hasn't kept my attention and playing it feels more like a chore at this point. The graphics are decent, but look like they were rendered on a ps3 instead of a ps4. combined with the disgusting motion blur effect for even slightly turning your gaze really put a damper on the graphics as they are only good looking when you stand still.
I liked the swap-out system for characters, and magic requirements for different spells felt natural. having to keep 12 characters leveled up and geared out at once was kind of annoying at first but I got used to it.

I would not recomend this game simply because it feels like it was slapped together, and still has some very obvious kinks to be worked out.",No: I don’t recommend this product,,1,3,6 years ago,3.0,4.0427,117
FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,Cool Enough Game,"There are waaaay too many characters and you can sort of tell from the gameplay and graphics that Type 0 is originally for the PSP, but other than that, the game was fairly decent. The story was good overall. If there's anything bad to say about the story telling, it's that it was slightly predictable. The gameplay was unique to other FF games and it was an action RPG instead of turn-based so that was fun in its own way. If you're a fan of Final Fantasy, this isn't a bad game to get.

FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,A great addition to my Final Fantasy collection,"This game is different from the other FF games because it is really dark. There is a decent amount of blood and destruction which kind of grips you. As far as all of the people complaining about the story and elements being so confusing, I don't really think they bothered to watch the in game CGs or read the in game historical texts. It is not that confusing and every element is explained if you take the time to look and listen. There are 3 levels of difficulty in the game and even on Cadet, it can be somewhat of a challenge. I grew up with turned based JRPGs and to write off this game because isn't turn based is a shame. Limiting yourself is unfortunate because the game is actually very good and provides well over 100 hours worth of content, replay, and activities. The camera can get you a little dazed but it isn't a deal breaker. The graphics could have certainly been remastered a little better but there are moments when the game looks absolutely fantastic. I use the remote play feature on my Vita sometimes and it plays amazingly considering it was originally a psp game. Square Enix should have offered this game as a Vita title as well but that is a different issue. The FF XV demo was a very nice addition and does take some getting used to. I own FF 1 through 14 and enjoy each game for its differences and uniqueness. None of them are perfect but they all offer something decent towards the Final Fantasy series.",yes: I recommend this product,,34,13,6 years ago,4.0,4.0427,117
FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,"Despite Other Reviews, Still a FF game.","I really don't understand why people say this isn't a Final Fantasy game. It's just an action-RPG, not a turn-based. It's a very refreshing change to the series. People complain that there are ranged enemies and they are using a full melee squad, well that's just dumb. It's still a Final Fantasy game so tactics are still used, a lot. You have to make a team that makes sense. If you play the turn-based versions, you wouldn't put 4 Tanks or 4 DPS in at once, why? Because it's stupid. That aside the combat is fun, given you have the brains to make the fun happen. Some characters are useless, a lot of them are really interesting.

My point is, the creators have made such a great game from the start, and now seem to be going in a strange direction. No one I know buys a racing game to dress up their avatar who is inside of a car most of the time.

FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,Final Fantasy Disappointment,"First of all, I would like to state that I know that this is a remake of the Japanese version of a hand held console. I understand this completely. I am a HUGE Final Fantasy buff and have been waiting for this for a long time. The games story is somewhat vague, but good enough to follow. I would have expected that they would have done a better job with the graphics and gameplay motion. The game was so choppy and unclear that I sometimes could not even follow what I myself were trying to do. This is not what I have become accustomed to when playing a game on the PS4. All in all it is worth the money to buy and play simply because you are a Final Fantasy fan, but for a regular gamer, I would not recommend this.

FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD,Square Enix,It's worth getting for the demo.,"Type-0 is an okay game, I haven't finished the game yet but the story line is interesting enough to keep playing. The beginning of this game is what impressed me the most. The story telling and the emotional impact of the drama I found was like no other final fantasy. War is depicted in this game as ruthless, bloody, and ugly. An army ravaging a city hellbent on victory. You witness the slaughter of many. Those who are innocent civilians, those who at the moment of dying being finished off without hesitation. Then you witness one with the will to survive. It's agonizing to watch someone dying but at the same time inspiring to see the will to live. After the opening events I was left very solemn but excited to start playing this game. Probably the best opening to any Final Fantasy. I've played this game quite a bit but it doesn't continue with the same intensity of story telling. Then again i'm sure it has some great moments I haven't reached yet. It's a very unique game, kind of reminds me of Persona 4 somewhat. Type-0 actually blends quite a bit of other final fantasy elements into this game. I'm really not being really critical of this game, not everyone will enjoy certain aspects. I really think the level development/outlay of the areas you visit are basic/simple at best. Although i'm only 3 to 4 hours into this game, from what I saw this seems to be the norm. I'm positive this game will have quite a bit of replay value. More characters then any other Final Fantasy you will have at your disposal. Difficulty selection will be nice for the hardcore gamer. I started on the officer difficulty and it's not that challenging, at least not for me. The graphics are okay i'm not complaining. Although some people might think it's garbage because it doesn't resemble a next gen PlayStation 4 game. It's in high definition its very smooth/fluid. The textures such as the grass are not bad but then again it doesn't look like Final Fantasy XV. Speaking of Final Fantasy XV you get a code to download it. It's around 5.2 Gigabytes so download it. It's really fun, open world, great graphics, and a new fighting system. This demo is worth the purchase of Type-0 in my opinion. The demo will take you a few hours to complete, which is good because you won't finish it too fast. The time changes from day to night. The night invites tougher monsters for an added challenge and gains the group some experience you will get to reap once you rest at a campground. There's witty banter between the group as you explore the world which makes the travel a little more interesting as you travel to objectives. Getting in a battle, the enemy sees you a red line flashes across the screen until it expands the entire width of the screen. You can also hide by pressing/holding the L2 button, then get out of view behind a tree, or rock. It's also a really suspenseful game you will see once you start the hunt for ""Dead eye."" Also you will find a summon, you will like this A LOT! I did, but don't take my word for it, try it out yourself.

I think there's a version coming out that will additionally support Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, so you may want to hold off and wait for that one, but idk the full details.

Forza Horizon 4 - Xbox One,Microsoft,You Should Race to get This Game,I absolutely love this game. I consider myself a causal gamer and I first got introduced to horizon 3 and fell in love. The racing style combined with the great car selection and customization is an awesome mix.

Also there are new  and interesting events such as stunts and perks for your cars. As with all horizon games there is also a good balance of keeping it challenging and entertaining.
