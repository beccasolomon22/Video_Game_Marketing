## Motivation

The world of Video Games has grown exponentially over the years. Many of us have even debated going into the video game industry and all of us are effected by the Video Game Industry since we are avid Gamers. Due to the industry effecting all of us on a daily basis with us constantly discussing which video games are the best, old graphics versus new graphics, we decided to find out if there is a Method to the Madness of Video Games. Can we create a Machine Learning Model to predict what type of video games are going to do the best in the future.

## Background

  One of the first video game was developed in 1958, Tennis For Two, which simulates a tennis game viewed from the sidelines. Since then, the gaming industry has grown remarkably. Obviously, the number one catalyst for the evolvement of video games is the rapid growth of the tech industry. In 65 years, video games have advanced from being console only to console, pc/mac, handheld, cellphone, and now even through virtual reality. 
  Not only did advances in technology help grow this industry, but also, unsuspectingly, the COVID-19 pandemic. When the lockdowns began in 2020, people needed to find a new way to interact with friends and/or family that did not just involve a group videocall or a watch party. It was at this time did the gaming industry suddenly took center stage. Video game streames on Twitch.tv reached record highs. E-sports gaining global recognition that the Olympics created an Esport series in 2023. 

The gaming industry is and will continue to rise with Market Research Future (MRFR) forecasting the industry to attain a value of 546.99 billion USD by 2030.
